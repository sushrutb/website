###### StartupForStartups

First business I built was StartupForStartups, which worked with handful of startups from across the world. Most successful of these are [BriteBill](https://www.britebill.com/) acquired by Amdocs for more than $100MM, and [M2Wealth](https://m2wealth.com) which is going strong.

<br/>
###### Prolinkd

Prolinkd was a sales automation tool which provided autmation of upsell and cross sell paths for large B2B enterprises. It used social data to capture business lifecycle signals and used those signals to advise sales teams.
The product was used by some of the biggest names in IT, advertising, software services, telecom companies.
Eventually product was shut down due to changing market conditions in utilizing third party social data.

###### Wisebuy

Wisebuy was product search and price comparison engine. It captured product and pricing information from hundreds of sites in India, built a catalog of more than 90 million listings. At its peak wisebuy had 400K unique monthly visitors, with 2 million search queries a day.
Product was shutdown as I was not keen to fight the SEO/SEM war. Underlying technology was licensed to handful of customers and lives on.
