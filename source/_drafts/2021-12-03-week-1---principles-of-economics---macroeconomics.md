> GDP is market value of all finished goods and services.

Finished goods are goods which are not sold again.

* Input goods that are used in making finished products. Flour used by a bakery, raw materials used to produce a car.

GDP can increase because of prices going up and or production going up.

Real GDP normalises against inflation, that is change in prices. So real GDP measures increase in production.
