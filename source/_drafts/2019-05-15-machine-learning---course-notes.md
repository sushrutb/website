### What is machine learning?
>Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

### Types of machine learning.
* Supervised - teach the computer how to do something.
* Unsupervised - computer learns by itself.
* Reinforced Learning.
* Recommender systems.

#### Supervised learning
* Classification problems where output is from set of discrete values.
  * Email is spam or not.
* Regression problems where result is within a continuous output.
  * House prices.

#### Unsupervised learning
* Structure of the data is unknown.
* Used to determine structure of the data and derive features.
