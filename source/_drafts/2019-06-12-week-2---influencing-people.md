### <span>Influencing and persuasion with out formal authority.</span>

##### Social proof
* Show examples of other doing similar to what you are proposing.
* Show others have succeeded in doing similar thing.
* Share testimonials.

> Informal power > formal power.

##### Authority as an influence tactic
* Authority - We respond to mere signs and symbols of authority.
* Use of business attire or attire that is compliant with authority figure.
* Develop reputation for being an expert.
* Associate with higher powered people.
* Indicate your expert by using correct language such as jargon.

##### Cognitive biases
* Availability - we are influenced by readily available, vivid memory.
* Stories are more influencing than numbers.
* Framing Bias - We are risk averse to gain, but we are risk seeking towards loss.
* Anchoring - We are anchored to first price point.
