### Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium


#### Demand curve

>Graphs quantity demanded at various price points. Quantity demanded decreases if price increases, as less consumers are willing to purchase the product.

#### Supply curve
>Graphs quantity supplied at various price points. Quantity supplied increases if price increases, as more suppliers are willing to supply the product.

#### How to interpret supply and demand curve?
* If price of a product decreases, consumers who were buying products which are substitutes, are now buying the product.
* If price of a product increases, suppliers who were making other products, are now supplying the product.

#### Supply and demand equilibrium price point.
* When supply and demand are graphed, equilibrium is where these intersect.
* In a free market, market forces are always trying to push the price towards equilibrium.
* If price is above equilibrium, there is product surplus as demand < supply. This pushes the price down, towards equilibrium.
* If price is below equilibrium, there is product shortage as demand > supply. This pushes the price up, towards the equilibrium.

> At equilibrium, total gains from the trade are maximized.

#### Consumer surplus
* It is _profit_ made by consumer.
* It is the difference between a maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and price of the product.
