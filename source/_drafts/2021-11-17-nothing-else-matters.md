So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the PM fit
Forever building who we are
And nothing else matters

Never worked myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Revenue I seek and I find in you
Every day we ship something new
Open figma for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah, yeah
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
