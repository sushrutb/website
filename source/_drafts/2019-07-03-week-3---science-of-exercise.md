### <span>Fitness and performance</span>


##### Endurance training
* When you regularly exercise, body will adapt. 3-5 times a week, for few months.
* Adaptations depend on - frequency, intensity, duration, and type of exercise.
* Frequency
  * Don't be a weekend warrior when it comes to exercise.
  * 3 to 5 days a week is ideal.
* Intensity is most important when it comes to adaptations.
  * Use heart rate monitors.
  * Intensity should be 50-85% of heart rate reserves.
  * (heart rate reserve/100) * (max HR 210 - resting HR) + Rest HR
  * Max HR = 220 - age
  * __For me to train at 85% HR reserve: 85%/100 * (220 - 37 - 66) + 66 = 165 bpm__
  * __For me to train at 85% HR reserve: 50%/100 * (220 - 37 - 66) + 66 = 125 bpm__
* Duration
  * 20 to 60 mins of exercise.
* Type or mode
  * Should involve large muscle groups.
* A training program should have
  * Designated recovery days.
  * Designated hard training weeks, followed by recovery weeks.
  * Start with low intensity, lower duration and gradually increase both.

##### What happens when you stop training.
* Reversibility - all adaptations will be reversed with time once you stop training.
* Reversal of various adaptations is quite fast and will occur within weeks after training is stopped.

##### Strengh training
* Strength training adaptations depend on - frequency, intensity, number of repetitions per set, and number of sets.
* After a period of strength training, output plateaus, factors affecting it
  * Physical activity
  * Nutrition
  * Genetics
  * Endocrine influences
  * Nervous system
  * Environmental.
  * Growth hormones such as testosterone.

##### Differences for men and women in strength training.
* Men have more muscles and larger cross sectional areas.
* _A man and a woman having same muscle mass can generate same amount of power and force._
* Due to very large quantities of testosterone (20-30 times), amount of muscle gain in men can be much higher.

##### Nutrition for training
* How much to eat?
  * Endurance - weight stable.
* What to eat?
  * Endurance
    * Increasing carb stores.
    * 55-60% calories from carbs.
* When?
  * Takes 24 hours to replenish carb stores.
  * First 1 to 2 hours post exercise.
  * Pre-competition meal -
    * 2 to 3 hours prior - reduces blood requirements of digestive system and stabilizes glucose level
    * 300-500 calories, high in carbs.

##### Causes Of Muscle fatigue
* Muscle fatigue is inability to maintain output required during exercise.
* Common causes are located in the muscle itself.
* For Endurance exercise
  * Depletion of carb stores.
  * Calcium levels
  * Body and muscle temperature.

##### Causes of muscle soreness


##### Performance enhancing drugs
