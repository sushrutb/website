### The price system

Free markets are governed by the invisible hand of pricing. Free markets consist of very large number of strangers who need to collaborate with each other for their own self interest. How do these large number of stranger collaborate?

> Price is a signal wrapped up as an incentive.

* In a free market with lots of participants, everyone wields a small influence.
* A consumer can decide to buy or not buy a particular good at a given market price.
* This effectively means that the consumer values the good _less than_ the market price.
* This is a signal to the suppliers to find cheaper ways to produce the same good, driving the price down.
* This gives everyone a little bit of influence on price.

> World market is not a story of competition, but it is a story of collaboration.

#### The great economic problem

All markets are linked together.

> The great economic problem is - How to arrange our limited resources to satisfy as many of our wants as possible?

#### How to allocate resources?

* Central Planning
  * Tried in communist countries.
  * Resources are allocated by a central figure.
  * Problems with this approach is there is too much information to be digested by single person or committee.
  * Markets are too interlinked so it is hard to know 2<sup>nd order effects.
  * There are too few incentives to allocated resources to maximize the outcome.

<pre>
Price = Marginal value.
      = Lowest value satisfied demand.
      = Highest value unsatisfied demand.
      = Social opportunity cost.
