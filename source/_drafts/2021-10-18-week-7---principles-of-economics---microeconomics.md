### Externalities

Costs of trade
* Private cost - Paid by the consumer or the producer.
* External cost - A cost paid by bystanders, by people other than the consumer or the producer.

Social cost of trade = Private cost + External cost.

Externalities deal with external cost.

> Market does __not__ maximize social surplus.

### External Costs

When there are external costs of trade, output should be reduced.
Who bears the cost is irrelevant.

#### Solutions

* Pigouvian Tax
  * For example tax on cigarattes.
  * Tax increases price and reduces output.
  * If tax can capture external costs, then it can be great way to reduce output.

### External Benefits

Benefits to bystanders.

For example - Vaccine. They protect not just the consumer of the vaccine, but bystanders whose risk of infection is reduced.

In case of external benefits Social Value > Private Value.

#### Pigouvian Subsidy

* In case of external benefits, output should be increased.
* One way to achieve that is by subsidies trades.
* This is known as Pigouvian subsidy.
