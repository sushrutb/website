> Just because you are smart, does not mean you can write!

Writing is an art form and requires practice and learning to master it.

From the ![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)

We use one way to think about stuff and a different way to write about it. This leads the user to
1. Slow down while reading or has to re-read a lot.
2. Does not understand, or skips over parts that they dont understand.
3. Forms negative emotion about the subject matter.

> Professional writing is about changing ideas your reader has, _not_ communicating your ideas.

We learn to write by writing for teachers, who are interested in understanding how much we know, are trying to help us, and are paid to do so. They almost always will read everything.

Readers in professional world are reading our material so they get a better understanding of the world and find ideas valuable. They almost always will *not* read everything, skip over parts, unless they find it valuable.
