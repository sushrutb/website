##### Types of muscle systems
* Skeletal
* Cardiac/Heart.
* Smooth - muscles surrounding blood vessels.

##### Skeletal muscles
* Types of contractions
  * Isometric - no change in length.
    * Planking.
  * Concentric - muscle shortens.
    * Curls, presses. Most common form of contraction.
  * Eccentric - muscle lengthens.
    * Downhill running
* Contractions cause muscle soreness.
* Consists of 3 types of fibers.
* Type I fibers - high in mitochondria, can use fats aerobically, so slow to fatigue and hence important for endurance.
* Type IIx fibers - Use anaerobic paths to generate energy. Very fast, so required in exercises where you need lot of force, very quickly, for short durations.
* Type IIa fibers - Mixture of properties from type IIx and type I.
* Average person have 50-50% of type I and type II fibers.

##### Respiratory systems
* Roles of respiratory systems
  * Oxygen supply is maintained.
  * Eliminate CO<sub>2</sub> from the system.
  * Buffering metabolic acids used during exercise.
* 98.5% of oxygen is carried by hemoglobin (red blood cells).
* Drop in pH and increase in body temperature, causes more oxygen to be unloaded into muscles. _Warmup is important._
* Endurance training will lead to increase in red blood cells count.
* During exercise, ATP production leads to increase demand for oxygen, leading to increased quantity of CO<sub>2</sub>.
* Ventilatory rate - process of moving air into and out of the lungs.
  * Affected by breathing frequency.
  * Tidal volume. - It is better, as it provides more time to complete gas exchange.
* __Valsalva maneuver__ - Grunting during exercise forces blood supply to heart to drop, forcing heart to pump more blood. But can lead to fainting or dizziness.
