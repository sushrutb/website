### <span>Quantifiers</span>

All mathematical quantifiers can be expressed in either _there exists_ or _for all_.

##### There exists
* There exists an object x having property P.
* Denoted by symbol - __∃__
* For example ∃x[x<sup>2</sup>+2x+1=0]
* You can prove it by finding x which satisfies the property.

_Continuous function - Graph of the function does not have any breaks or joints_

##### For all
* For all x it is the case that.
* Denoted by symbol - __∀__
* For example - ∀x(x<sup>2</sup> >= 0).
