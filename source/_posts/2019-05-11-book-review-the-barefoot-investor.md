This is the most important book that I read in 2018. It is targeted towards Australians, but the basic ideas are applicable everywhere. Here is a summary of ideas from the book.

#### Ensuring your financial well being
* Choose banking institutions which have the lowest fees, ideally zero fees.
* Save at least 10% of your paycheck for retirement fund (RF).
  * In Australia, this is your super.
* Invest your RF in a diversified portfolio.
  * Also make sure fees charged by your financial products is as low as possible.
  * Don't hire wealth advisers who charge a percent fees.
* Automate your banking.
  * Create an expense account.
    * Deposit monthly expenditure money in this account.
    * Create and maintain a monthly budget.
    * Watch out for small but frequent expenses.
  * Create a goal oriented savings account(splurge). For trips, splurges and so on.
  * Create an emergency fund (EF) account, ideally this account is not easy to withdraw from.
  * Keep mone to cover at least 3 months of expenses in EF.
* Property
  * Dont invest in property.
  * Only buy the house you are going to live in.
  * Always negotiate your mortgage down.
  * Dont fall for mortgage traps, getting extras. Focus on keeping fees down.
* Credit and debt
  * Use your splurge account to get rid off any debts.
  * Get rid off your credit card.
    * Unless you can automate credit card bill payment, having it is not worth it.
    * Most miles etc are useless and not worth the risk of having a credit card.
* Earn more.
  * Learn to negotiate your pay.
  * Figure out a way to get extra income.
    * Sell stuff you dont need.
    * Acquire skills to start a side business.
* Give back
  * Whatever little you can.


> Most important lesson you can learn is - __Power Of Compounding__. A small pay rise every year, will compound to bring you lot of money in next 10-20-30 years. All small fees you save, will add up to become significant over a period of time. __Think long term__.
