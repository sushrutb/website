## Using CAP Theorem for Decision Making in Life

The CAP theorem, originating from computer science, suggests that in a distributed system, you can only prioritize two out of three characteristics: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (the ‘C,’ ‘A,’ and ‘P’ in CAP).

However, let's explore how we can use this theorem metaphorically to make important life decisions. This approach isn’t a strict framework but rather a method to prioritize what truly matters to us.

### Applying CAP Theorem to Choosing a Place to Live

Imagine you're deciding where to live. What are the most critical factors influencing your decision? For me, these are location, features, and budget.

- **Location**: Where it is situated and what it offers in terms of amenities, community, and surroundings.
- **Features**: The specifics of the home or apartment, including size, amenities, security, noise levels, etc.
- **Budget**: The overall cost implications, including daily expenses like commuting costs and additional purchases.

### How to Use CAP Theorem in Decision Making

#### Step 1: Prioritize Your Key Attributes

Identify the two attributes that are most crucial to you and determine which one you can afford to compromise on, if necessary. For me, location and features are paramount, while budget is flexible.

#### Step 2: Refine Your Priorities

Within each key attribute, further prioritize sub-attributes. For instance, in choosing a location, I prioritize access to nature, proximity to essential places like work and markets, and the neighborhood's community vibe.

#### Step 3: Continuously Narrow Down

Continue applying this method to refine your priorities until you've identified the best options that align with what matters most to you.

#### Bonus: Involving Others

If the decision involves multiple stakeholders, this process can help find common ground by understanding each person's priorities and flexibility.

## Where Can You Apply CAP Theorem?

This approach can be applied to various significant decisions in life:

- Choosing a new home
- Deciding on a new job
- Selecting a topic to learn
- Planning a vacation destination
- Even in relationships, identifying what qualities you seek in a partner
- Determining which project to pursue next, and more



> It’s essential to approach important decisions with intentionality and self-awareness about your values and priorities.


##### Footnotes

[^1]: The number of attributes doesn't have to be three, but it should be kept minimal to prioritize effectively.
[^2]: Examples include proximity to work, community spaces, shops, markets, and schools.
[^3]: Assess whether the neighborhood fosters opportunities to meet interesting people and form communities.
