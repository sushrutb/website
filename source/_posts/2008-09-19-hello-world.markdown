<p>Okay, sorry to start the blog in the geekiest way but :-) . Anyways.Â  Also excuse me for not having a great looking blog for now, just don&rsquo;t have time to spend on decorating it.</p>

<p>Essentially was going through few articles about startups etc and have been planning to start the blog from a really long time. Inspired from the article, here I am.</p>

<p>So I am going to talk about mainly technology, startup eco-system in india. But along with that there will be few reviews about movies/books/songs and any random thing that I like. Being an entrepreneur I have realized the closer I am to the world, more ideas flow through my mind. I really hate people who say I have not got time in last 1 year to watch a good movie like The Dark Knight. WTF! You should try and get 1-2 hours of time every day to explore whats happening in the world. You should be connected to it all the time. Listen to songs while working, if not songs then atleast instrumentals. Watch a movie once in a while. Get a away from hectic life and connect to nature once a month. Read nice book. I read everyday for average 1 hour. Its one of the best habit to have.</p>

<p>So if you are looking to get into something which might be the next big thing you know where subscribe button is :-) .</p>
