<p><i><br/>I want to be a poet<br/>and write about<br/>all those struggles and pain,<br/>and how a fight is never in vain.<br/><br/>I want to be a poet<br/>and write about<br/>we, hand in hand, you and me<br/>and how in your eyes, my world I see.<br/><br/>I want to be a poet<br/>and write about<br/>innocent dew on winter morning,<br/>and how nature keeps us going.<br/><br/>I want to be a poet <br/>and write about <br/>God, and all his giving<br/>and how to pray to be forgiving.<br/></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-5730118395523129959?l=soranthou.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
