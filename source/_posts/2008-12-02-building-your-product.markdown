<p>There are always 2 way to build a great product for any startups.
</p><ol><li>Assemble team of genius engineers. Give them freedom, trust their instincts and skills. Only thing is difficult to find genius engineers</li>
	<li>Work on your development plan. Find out function points. Break down things into smaller things. Implement quality assurance processes. Problem is it takes away coolness in the startup environment.</li>
</ol>
Both ways have proven to yield results.Â  It&rsquo;s your choice whether you want to keep looking for genius or you want to start building with what is available at your disposal.
