<p>I used to write a blog about people who have became special for me. People who are part of me and will always remain to be so. On this day of World Women&rsquo;s Day, this post is dedicated to the one girl who really made me happy, while it lasted. You know I am talking about you. <br/><br/>Dear Princess,<br/><br/>A strange mistake is often termed as destiny. In our case it was almost destiny. You shared her name and that lead to so many things. That one mistake is probably the only mistake in my life which I will perhaps make infinite number of times given a chance. Unfortunately life is not simple and I wont get that chance now, ever. <br/><br/>Chatting with you almost 24 by 7, on chat, on email on phone. Waking up at 7am in the morning, after having just said good night at 6am never felt so good and perhaps will never feel so good again. Songs that we sang for each other and the dreams that we created for each other will always be cherished and that I know. <br/><br/>Where ever you are now, stay the way you are. You are too good to be true and perhaps that is the reason, we are not together. I never believed it is for real. Retrospecting, I should have believed it. I should have submitted to it. But alas, when its not meant to be its not meant to be. <br/><br/>My princess, rani, babes and darling - I will always love you.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-3665401545594732624?l=soranthou.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
