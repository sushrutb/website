<p>I do not trust Indian ecommerce sites. Period. Whether it is freecharge or snapdeal or some other. And it is nothing to do with any previous issues with a particular ecom site. Issue is simple - coupons.</p><p>Amazon provides a consistent price. If there are any coupons of special deals, they are right in my face. There are not hidden via third party sites. Eg I went to freecharge to recharge my prepaid. Then realized I should go to some third party site to find a coupon. So googled freecharge coupon. Found one. Applied it and saved 50 bucks. I do not think I want to give my money to site which gives different price to different customers based on their behavior. So now I am going to stick to amazon.in and for everything else, walk to corner grocer. At least his payment gateway has never failed me.</p>
