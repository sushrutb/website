![Goa](/images/goa-sunset-2.jpg)

I have been living in Goa for more than 2 years now. As many people have asked how it is like living here, a detailed posts on the experience so far.

## Why Goa?

Most common question I have received is why I chose to move to Goa.

>Goa is a rural place with access to _almost_ all urban comforts.

## Pros

### Access to culture

It has a fairly vibrant art scene, especially music. Lots of indie artists, as well couple of large music festivals like Sunburn.

Very good local theatre scene, mostly due to Kala academy. Although almost all of it is in Marathi or Konkani. There is one very good theatre in Ponda, and 2 old but still functional theatres in Mapusa and Bicholim that often have performances of popular Marathi plays.

Classical music is not as accessible, only occasional performances.

Many Goan villages have there own festivals that are unique to them and it is almost interesting to participate in them.

Flagship arts event in Goa, Serendipity Arts Festival, happens in second half December and has some amazing performances in theatre, music, and dancing.

### Infrastructure

None of the large home broadband/fiber companies operate in Goa. However there are couple of local operators and they are good enough.

Roads are narrow, but mostly okay. Even though petrol pumps are not as many, most shops will sell a bottle petrol.

Plenty of rental apartments and houses available.

Food delivery apps have great coverage, so plenty of options to order.

### Food

Good coffee and cafes are quite important to me. And Goa, especially around Assagaon, Anjuna, and Vagator area have lots of options.[^1]

Outside of touristy areas, you will find plenty of very good and cheap food options. If you are either non-vegetarian or pescatarian, Goa has you covered.

And it is not just local Goan or Indian food, there is now plenty of options for most world food. From Lebanese to Japanese to Fusion, lots of new restaurants catering a variety of choices.

Even though I do not drink much and very rarely drink cocktails, there is no shortage of choices there.

As Goa has number of non Indians visiting/living, it has better availability of exotic vegetables and fruits supply.

### Community

There are many hobby groups and communities you can join based on interests. Dance is extremely popular here. Social events centered around dancing are quite accessible, just get few lessons beforehand.

During Winter, November to February, many localities have open markets, where local artists and creators showcases their work. There are few permanent markets, such Hill Top in Anjuna.

Even few book clubs, board-gaming groups, and quizzing groups are active.

If you are a member or ally of LGBT+ community, then there are at least a couple of groups very active that organize socializing and awareness events.

### Nature

Goa has many wonderful beaches. At least a few not as busy as main touristy beaches of Baga and Calangute.

It also has lush green forests, hiking trails, waterfalls, and natural lakes. Plenty to explore. There are few abandoned quarries that become lakes during monsoon, but do __not__ go swimming in them, quite dangerous.

Lots of wildlife, especially birds, reptiles, and drunk humans.

### Sports and Fitness

Lots of football clubs and biking groups. Few government sports complex and private sports clubs. Plenty of yoga and other fitness activities available.

### Weather

While days, 9am to 5pm, are quite hot and at times humid, mornings and evenings are quite pleasant all year around, including summer. It is a beautiful place in monsoon.

### Connectivity

Goa now has two airports and very well connected with rest of India. Once the new airport is fully functional, it will have even direct connectivity to major European destinations. It is also well connected to parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka by road and railway.

## Cons

### Infrastructure limitations

While Goa does a great job of pretending to be an urban area, it is still very much a rural area.
Electricity outages, no matter what Twitter warriors say, are frequent.
Roads while good, if they get damaged do not get fixed as quickly.

And most importantly, you can not live here just on public transport. Bus network is extensive, but not as frequent and many areas not covered due to very narrow roads. Buses are not well maintained and time table is more of a guidance than a rule. There no on-demand taxi services such as Uber or Ola and local taxi service is run by a mafia with poor service and exorbitant pricing.

So if you are going to live here you have to have your own transport. You can rent on a monthly basis, motorcycles and cars, quite easily.

Many, or most, apartments are not designed to live in for long term. They are mostly designed for short term rentals with limited storage spaces, small kitchens, and generally bad user experience.

### Support Services

It is hard to find good cooks and housekeepers. If you do not have very specific food tastes or can train, then finding a cook a bit easier.

Outside of urban centers like Panjim, Mapusa, Porvorim, and Margao, it is quite difficult to find good plumbers, electricians, and other support services. Quality of these service providers is also quite low.

Goa is a rural place, do not expect same level of professionalism you would in say Mumbai.

### Costly

As it is a popular tourist destination, many things are priced at exorbitant levels. Apartment rent, taxis, bike/car rental. Closer you are to the beach, higher the prices.

However, there are plenty of high quality local food available away from touristy areas.

### Substance abuse

It is a party place. People come here to have a good time. And most of it is centered around drinking alcohol. It is extremely hard to resist over-drinking and smoking in Goa. Most places are smoking friendly and a very large population does smoke. Other drugs are not as overtly accessible, but not very difficult to either.

If you are someone who has addition issues, or has tendency to be influenced by peer pressure, you will find it is difficult to resists those in Goa.

Culture of partying does attract specific kinds of people to Goa. If you are not one of them, you may find it difficult to build friendships, as lot of socializing happens over late night partying. [^2]

### People

Like every other place Goa has mix of nice and not so nice people. Rural communities across the world are not open minded and Goa is no exception to that. Xenophobia, especially against other Indians, is quite common. I do not think Goa has higher percentage of it compared to other rural communities.

## Conclusion

>Overall benefits of living in Goa far outweigh costs.


##### Footnotes

[^1]: I will do a separate post on just Cafes in Assagaon.
[^2]: Most parties/events do not even start till around mid-night. Clubs are pretty much empty between 7 to 10pm.
