Many young people tend to fail at written communication and here is an attempt to provide some tips.

> Good communication clearly conveys intent, content, and desired outcome.


In your personal or professional life try to build a bit of empathy for other person, who is reading your text/email/message.

## Intent

A typical interaction when person 1 (P1) is trying to arrange a date with P2 looks like this.

```
P1: Hey, it has been nice interacting with you online, shall we get together for a coffee this weekend?
P2: Nah, I have a busy weekend ahead.
```

Nothing wrong with not having free time, however, in this communication main intent P1 was looking for is not exact time when P2 is free, but whether they are interested in escalating their *relationship* from online to offline. Also, please remember a yes means yes and anything else essentially means no. If you are looking for people who will persist after a *non-yes* [^1], you might be dating in the wrong century.

Better way to convey your intent clearly like this.

```
P2: Hey, I would love to catch up for a coffee, however this weekend this quite busy. I am free on Saturday week, if that works?
```

You are clearly letting someone know you are interested in them, that you understand how to manage your schedule a little ahead of time.

This is not just useful in dating, but all inter-personal relationships that are new, where two people do not know each other that well.

> Do not put all burden an emotional labor of scheduling or communiting intent


## Scheduling


> As an adult you should be capable of managing your schedule, at least 2 weeks in advance, if not more.



#### Tips

1. Use any free/paid calendar system that works well with your email.
2. Ensure you setup automated vacation responder when you go on a leave.
3. Add all appointments, including personal, to your calendar.
4. If you are trying to setup a meeting, use intentful language. 
5. Instead of, "hey, let me know if you are going to in town on 18th, maybe we can meetup", try "hey, if you are in town 18th, I am free in the morning for a catch."



## Last minute cancellations

Everyone needs to cancel meetings at the last minute once in a while. Important things come, shit happens. I get it.

When this happens, please do communicate with your *date* [^1], as soon as you can.


#### Tips

1. For last minute cancellations - Hey sorry, something unforeseen has come up, is it at all possible for us to reschedule for another time, here are few times that work for me.
2. If they are traveling to meet you, please try and cancel before they are supposed to leave.
3. If you missed a meeting altogether, do no ghost people after that, instead - "Hey, I dropped the ball on our scheduled appointment, extremely sorry. I do want to have a chat with you, can we please schedule another meeting? Let me know your schedule and I will make sure to accommodate it."
4. Do not use condescending language such as something more important came up. Unforeseen is much better.
5. Do not ask for last minute cancellation because your day has been slammed. If that is going to be the case, ask for a cancellation first thing in the morning, or even better evening before. It shows that you can think ahead and plan your day well and are respectful of other persons schedule as well.


## Deadlines

Most people understand that deadlines are generally not urgent. The push for urgency is usually from lack of trust with other person. Either they have been impirically flaky or the relationship is new.

> If you do what you were going to do and by the time you said you were going to do it, most people will not bother you about deadlines.

#### Tips
1. Do not set aggressive targets for yourself. Your job is to build trust with other person.
2. If you going to miss a deadline, let other person.
3. People should never have to send you messages asking for an update. If they constantly have to, they will either never pay you well or find a different person.
4. When starting a new relationship, send a note about how you communicate about deadlines and scheduling work. Set clear expectations from the other person as well.


## Channels

> Every person has a favorite communication channel, try to find that out and stick to it.

I personally hate getting unscheduled phone calls. It triggers anxiety[^3] in me. If I have communicated to you to email or text me and you keep calling me, I am going to find someone else.

This may not be as extreme for other people, but it is important to understand what preferred method of communication is for any non-urgent things and stick it. Using multiple text based mediums, emails/whatsapp/text, make it difficult to organize information and chances of missing something are higher.




##### Footnotes

[^1]: It is not a yes, but was not supposed to a clear no either.
[^2]: Person you are meeting, not necessarily a romantic date.
[^3]: This when a loved was hospitalized and I used to get calls from hospital a lot.
