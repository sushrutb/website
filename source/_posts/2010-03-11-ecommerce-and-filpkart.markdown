<p>Till about 10 days ago total amount I had spent over ecommerce website in India was = Rs 1,200</p>

<p>In last 10 days it is = Rs 10,000 .</p>

<p>Change - Flipkart dot com.</p>

<p>Before I started using it, for getting books I had to go to Pune as lot of books are not available in Nasik. Now I receive them in about 3-4 days after ordering.</p>

<p>Things to learn -</p>

<p>1. Very simple user interface.</p>

<p>2. Excellent stock.</p>

<p>3. Great consumer experience.</p>

<p>4. Once you have created account you can order books using credit card in around 2 mins max.</p>

<p>If you are an entrepreneur venturing into this space, you have loads to learn from flipkart.com.</p>

<p>Disclosure - I am not at all related to flipkart.com, havent met any of their team members ever and have not received any special gifts for give this shout out. This post comes straight from the fact that I just ordered entire LOTR collection in 2 mins while waiting for a conference call.</p>
