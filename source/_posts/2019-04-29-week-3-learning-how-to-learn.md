#### Procrastination and Memory

##### Procrastination
* Brain zombies - automatic replies of brain to specific cues to make here and now better.
* We procrastinate about things we donâ€™t like.
* Procrastination is similar to addiction - provides temporary pleasure.
* Procrastination has feedback loop - making it harder and harder to get out of it.
* Neurologically - habit is an energy saver.
* Habit is four parts
  * Cue - the trigger.
  * Routine - the default response.
  * Reward - immediate feeling of pleasure.
  * Belief - why the default response, the story you tell yourself about why you have certain habits.

<br/>
##### Process vs Product
* Okay to feel negative when you thinking of doing something.
* Research finds that non procrastinators feel the same, but put those feelings aside.
* reframing helps with avoiding procrastination. Instead of thinking I am going to complete a task, think that you are going to work on something for 20mins, irrespective of whether you complete it or not.
* Build processes, small habits/chunks, to avoid procrastination.
* Focus on completing a pomodoro, rather than completing a task.
* Process also means you are not worried whether you are close to finishing the task or not or get worried when you are behind.
* Distraction free environment helps.

<br/>
##### Harnessing habits/zombies
* Cue
  * Understand which cues trigger procrastination - location, time, feeling, reaction.
  * Turning off distractions like cellphone etc will avoid most of the cues.
* Routing
  * Must need to actively focus to avoid going into the default habit.
  * Figure out a plan that works for you. Turn off wifi, or changing time of day to early morning. Or what ever works.
  * Might need to experiment a bit to figure out what is most suitable to you.
* Reward
  * Investigate why you are avoiding.
  * Figure out a different reward. Like an internal challenge. Or a piece of chocolate.
  * Celebrate bigger achievements with bigger rewards.
  * Habits create craving. So use that to create good habits.
  * Having a deadline does indicate a good reward and helps to be more productive.
  * Be patient.
* Belief
  * Hardest part is to believe that you are going to complete a task.
  * Specially when things are hard, you tend to go back to old habits.

<br/>
##### Task lists
* Write list of weekly goals or key tasks.
* Main a daily to do list.
* Important - always write to do list the evening before as research shows it helps with getting diffused mode engaged while sleeping to work on those tasks.
* Mix physical tasks like cleaning with mental tasks. Diffused mode breaks.
* Important - Plan time when you are going to stop working.
* Include your reward in the daily to do list or planner.
* Do the most important task or most disliked task in the morning. At least make progress on it.

<br/>
#### Memory
* We have really good spatial and visual memory.
* Using images as a way to store information can be very effective.
  * Lot of memory champions use image associations to retain information.
  * Use funny and evocative images.
* To move something from working to long term memory it should be memorable and needs repetition.
* Spaced repetition, index cards, note taking, oral repetition - all help build memory.
  * Anki system?

<br/>
##### Long term memory
* Hippocampus is important for learning and memory of facts and events.
* Memories are not fixed, they change all the time.
* It is possible to implant false memories.
* Memory consolidates over a period of time. If memory is retrieved it under goes reconsolidating. Hence spaced repetition is important for retaining knowledge.
* Astrocytes -
  * Provides nutrient to neurones, help repair neural damage.
  * Einstein had better than average amount of astrocytes.
  * Could be important to learning and intelligence?

<br/>
##### Techniques for building memory
* Make meaningful (visual) groups.
* Create abbreviations for meaningful groups.
* Associate numbers with important dates/figures.
* Mnemonics. Used a lot in fields like medicine.
* Memory palace technique
  * Useful grouping technique to store information.
  * Use known locations - like your house - and attach information to various parts.
  * Useful for grouping things that are not related to each other.
  * Useful for remembering lists - grocery list, list of cities etc.
