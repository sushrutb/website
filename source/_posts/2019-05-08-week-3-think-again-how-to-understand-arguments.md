##### Vices in arguments
* Premises are false.
* The premise does not provide good reason for conclusion.

##### Virtues in arguments
* Validity
* Soundness

##### Deductive arguments
* The conclusion should follow from the premise.
* Is trying to be valid.

> An argument is valid if and only if it is not possible that all the premises are true and conclusion is false.

##### Valid Arguments
* Not all premises need to be true.
* Validity is technical term and valid argument is not necessarily a good argument.
* Not based on what is true, but what can be true when determining validity of an argument.
* Validity is a necessary condition __not__ sufficient.

> An argument is sound if and only if _all_ of its premises are true and it is valid.

#### Soundness
* Conclusion has to be true.
