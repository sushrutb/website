##### Vices in arguments
* Premises are false.
* The premise does not provide good reason for conclusion.

##### Virtues in arguments
* Validity
* Soundness

##### Deductive arguments
* The conclusion should follow from the premise.
* Is trying to be valid.

> An argument is valid if and only if it is not possible that all the premises are true and conclusion is false.

##### Valid Arguments
* Not all premises need to be true.
* Validity is technical term and valid argument is not necessarily a good argument.
* Not based on what is true, but what can be true when determining validity of an argument.
* Validity is a necessary condition __not__ sufficient.

> An argument is sound if and only if _all_ of its premises are true and it is valid.

##### Soundness
* Conclusion has to be true.
* Arguments can be valid but not sound.

### Argument Reconstruction

> Goal of reconstruction is to make it easier to assess whether argument is good or bad.

##### Stages of Reconstruction
* Stage 1. - Close analysis.
* Stage 2. - Get down to basic
  * Remove all excess content.
    * Repetitions, _road markers_, tangents, red herring, examples.
    * Make sure that you have not removed any essential content.
    * Guarding and assuring terms can sometimes be removed.
  * List all explicity premises and conclusions in standard form.
* Stage 3. - Sharpen the edges.
  * Get explanation for things which are unclear.
  * Break up premises where possible.
* Stage 4. - Organize
  * Divide in subparts and put them in correct order.
  * Linear, joint, or branch structures or a combination thereof.
* Stage 5. - Fill in the gaps
  * Assess whether each argument is valid.
  * Add missing premises where needed.
  * Check each premise for truth.
* Stage 6. - Assess the argument.
