### <span>Close: Create a contract</span>

##### Perspectives on contracts
* A contract is an agreement enforceable by law.
* Obtaining contracts is the main goal of a business.

##### Sources of contract laws
* Common law
  * Originated in England
  * Uses laws and prior judgements of the court.
  * Contracts become larger as they need to cover wide variety of situations.
* Civil Law
  * Originated in Europe.
  * Uses code
  * Does not rely much on the precedences.
  * Contracts tend to be shorter as they can just reference the code.

##### What type of contract?
* Product/goods
  * US Commercial code
  * UN International sales of goods (81 countries).
* Real/property - follows law of the country (civil or common).
* Services - follows law of the country (civil or common).

##### The agreement
* Checklist
  * Is there an agreement?
  * Is there consideration?
  * Is the agreement legal?
  * Must the beal be in writing?
* Framework agreements
  * Preprinted leases, memorandum of agreement etc.
* Consideration
  * For a deal to be binding, both sides have to give something up.
  * In civil law countries consideration is not mandatory.
  * In common law countries consideration is mandatory.
* Is the agreement legal?
  * Should not be against local laws.
* Does the contract need to be in writing?
  * When you have a written agreement, law is confined to only enforce that, no extraneous promises made during negotiations.
  * Always include parol evidence clause in the contract.
  * Oral agreements are enforceable, with some exceptions.
  * Real estate agreements _must_ be in writing.
  * Good idea to always have agreements in writing.

##### Business vs legal objectives in contracts.
* Legal objectives
  * To create a binding contract which is enforceable.
  * Results in lengthy process, increased cost, and may affect relationships between parties.
* Lean contracts
  * Emphasize free market economics rather than legalities.
  * Include - price, IP rights, terms implied by law but not written in the contract.
* Visual contracts - making contracts more readable.
