<p>Since the resurrection of dot com phenomenon and with astounding success of youtube likes, many entrepreneurs dream of making it big.</p>

<p>There is no problem in such dreams.</p>

<p>But problem is entrepreneurs think that making it big in very quick time with not much efforts is very possible.</p>

<p>They dont realize, youtube like financial success is very rare and almost fluke.</p>

<p>It is not a repeatable success story.</p>

<p>You can never know if your venture will turn out to be a next youtube story.</p>

<p>So stop daydreaming.</p>

<p>People who always keep thinking that some Google will come and buy us out, all we need to do is have the product out there, are just kidding themselves.</p>

<p>People who think, even if we fail in dot com venture, some company will buy out our user base and hence we turn investors, are kidding themselves.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about what to do with your success or with your failure when you are running a company, then stop running the company.</p>

<p>You are not meant for entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is also not for retirement minded people, who wants to just make few lacks or couple of crore rupees and live the rest of life without doing anything, are the worst kind of entrepreneurs. In fact such people should join bureaucracy, as they dont even deserve to be in corporate life style.</p>
