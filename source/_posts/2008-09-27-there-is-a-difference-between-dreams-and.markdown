<p>Recently met a person who just moved back from US to India. Extremely successful professional. Technical background, business family, access to capital and MBA in Entrepreneurship. Now this same, very smart, person told me that I am planning to start 6-7 ventures in next 2 years in India. It does not end here, there is more stupidity to come. But I wont be in the executive management of any of the companies as I want to have some time free to dedicated to other consultation business. So what he was looking for is some partner who will do all the work and get 49% in returns.</p>

<p>Why even best of people want to do things like this. Is it just for fame? Or is it just to get tag of serial entrepreneur behind you so you can sit on some VCs investment advisory board. God knows the answers. But all I have to say is if you are not focused on one thing, chances of success are very limited. There is difference between dreaming to be an entrepreneur and fantasizing about being one. Learn difference.</p>
