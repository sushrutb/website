##### What is chunk
* A way to unite bits of information through meaning.
* When you are focused on learning prefrontal cortex makes useful neural connections
  * This doesn’t work as effectively under stress.
* Focused practice and repetition helps with creating chunks.
* Chunks help brain run more efficiently

<br/>
##### How to chunk?
* You learn bit by bit forming mini chunks.
* Step 1: Focused attention.
* Step 2: Under the idea.
* Step 3: Solving the problem yourself or doing it yourself creates neural patterns.
* Step 4: Understand the context - when are the new ideas you are learning applicable
  * Practice helps with bottom up chunking.
  * Top down learning - reading summaries, or reading highlights of a chapter - helps with understanding context.

<br/>
##### Illusions of competence
* Try recalling material after you read it - you learn better and at deeper level
* Re-reading more useful when spaced in time.
* Highlighting texts
  * Don’t over do it.
  * Look for important ideas before you start marking.
  * One sentence per paragraph.
* Test yourself, recall is a form of a test.
* Mistakes helps correct your thinking.
* Recall outside of study time.

<br/>
##### What motivates you?
* You cant learn something that you are not into, at least partly due to neuromodulators.
* Acetylcholine
  * Important for focused learning.
  * Help long term memory
* Dopamine
  * Is released when we get an unexpected rewards.
  * Dopamine signals are widely broadcasted and hence help learning.
  * Also controls expectation of future reward.
  * Addictive drugs release dopamine.
  * Lack of dopamine leads to parkinsons disease and even catonomia.
* Serotonin
  * Affects social activity.
  * Linked to risk taking.
* Emotions affect learning and memory.
* Amygdala  - major center for cognition and memory integration.
* brainfacts.org

<br/>
##### Value of a library of chunks?
* To enhance knowledge it is important to build up chunks of knowledge and form creative connections between them.
* Preformed chunks help with learning new ideas
* As you keep learning, you start forming bigger chunks.
  * And you learng a bit easily as you go along.
  * Diffuse brain can them help finding solutions to new problems.
* A chunk library useful in classification and patterns in problem solving.
* Problem solving - Sequential thinking or holistic thinking.
  * Sequential = focused mode thinking.
  * Holistic - diffused mode. Required in solving hard problems as they require new ideas.
* Don't get stuck while learn. If something seems hard, skip it for now. Once you learn other things it will become easier to learn that concept.

<br/>
##### Over learning, choking, einstellung, and interleaving.
* Continuously practicing in the same session, is not as effective.
* Study session should consist of focus on learning harder content - deliberate practice.
* Einstellung(mindset) - existing neural patterns prevents new patterns from forming. Obstructing new ideas.
* Unlearn older ideas to learn new ideas.
* Dont jump straight to solving problems, first learn the context and give your brain time to work past the mindset.
* Interleaving is going back and forth between types of problem to help form connections between chunks.
* Interleaving helps you think creatively and independently.
