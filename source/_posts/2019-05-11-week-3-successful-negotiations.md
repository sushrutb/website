##### Getting To Know The Other Side
* Understand negotiation style of other side.
* Very important in cross cultural negotiations.
* Conversation intelligence.
  * Dont talk too much, so avoid your favorite topics.
  * Ask a lot of questions, people like to talk.
  * Listen.

##### Power In Negotiations
* Information is the biggest source of power.
* Information about the other side's BATNA is critical.
* Dont share your BATNA if it is weak.
* Try to weaken the BATNA of other side.
* Strengthen your BATNA.
  * In some cases you can form coalitions to strengthen your BATNA.

##### Psychological Tools
* Mythical fixed pie assumption - out interests are in conflict with other side.
  * Reactive devaluation.
* Anchoring - who comes up with first price?
  * If value is uncertain - let other side come up with first price.
  * If value is certain - set first price to anchor the negotiation
  * In case of stalemate - use similar deals as a way to break it
* Overconfidence
  * Makes you select a narrow range when calculating ZOPA.
  * Try to use disconforming evidence.
* Framing
  * When we have a positive choice, a gain, we are risk averse.
  * When we have a negative choice, a loss, we are pro risk.
* Availability
  * We are influenced easily by information which is (easily) available.
* Escalation
  * Look at negotiation from other side.
  * Competitive Arousal
    * Causes - intense rivarly, time pressure, spotlight.
    * Avoid - limit role of intense neogitator, manage time, spread responsibility.
* Reciprocity - helping the other side is useful.
* Contrast Principle
  * We compare an option with other available options, not on it own.
  * So good idea to show some really bad options, so the option you want to sell becomes much more attractive.
* Big picture - dont get lost in the details.
