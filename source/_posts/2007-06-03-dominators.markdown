<p>World of sports saw lot of people dominating there field during 1990s and trend continues in 2000s<br/></p><ol><br/><li> M Schum (F1)<br/></li><li> V Rossi (MotoGP 500cc)<br/></li><li> T Woods (Golf)<br/></li><li> P Samprass (Tennis)<br/></li><li> S Graff (Tennis)<br/></li><li> R Federer (Tennis)<br/></li><li> L Armstrong (Bicycle riding Tour de france)<br/></li><li> I Thorpe (Swimming sprints)<br/></li><li> Lakers (the team) <br/></li><li> Australia (the team, cricket and rugby)<br/></li></ol><br/><br/>Is it good or bad for sport that one individual or team dominates entire world? OR is it just passing phase?<br/>(By the way these are the sports I follow, dont know how things are in other sports. Apart from these I also follow soccer but thankfully we see no one dominating really.)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-5216219825356363544?l=soranthou.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
