## Essential Tremors

> Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder causing involuntary, rhythmic shaking, primarily in the hands and arms during action, though it can also affect the head, voice, or legs, disrupting tasks like writing or drinking

I have had essential tremors since I remember.

I only got diagnosed with it when I was around 30 years old.

#### Lived experience

My hands almost always have a mild tremor. In certain anxiety inducing conditions, it is visible.

Growing up, I have had two seizures. One resulted in mild trauma on teeth, I essentially went from standing upright to face down on hard floor.

The other one was on a playground, did not result in any injuries.

Both times, I was taken to doctors and so on, but they could not figure out it is due to tremors.

#### How it affected my life?

My hand writing is aweful. Resulting in lower markers than I deserved.

I was often called clumsy, prone to breaking things. Or not paying attention.

Especially when visiting someone else's house, I would often get bullying looks from certain family members.

After growing up, it did affect my dating life a little bit. At least until I got diagnosed and could explain the condition to myself and to my date.

#### Minor adjustments to manage

1. Use heavier pens. Of course nowadays writing by hand is not required as much. But if you know a kid who is in schoold and has *really* bad hand writing, worth investigating and getting a heavier pen.

2. At home I use beer mugs for beverages. They have nice handles, and are half-pint sized so, you don't fill them up to the edges.

3. Lifting weights - this has done wonders to tremors. Especially compound movements like deadlifting and RDLs.

4. In social situations, just order something that does not trigger drinking/eating anxiety. No soups for example. If option available, order in a to-go cup, or carry one that has a lid.

> Note to parents - this is not a common conditions. So if your kid has tremors, make sure you notice signs. Handwriting is almost always a giveaway.
