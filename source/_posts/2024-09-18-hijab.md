# Why I Support Schools That Ban Hijabs (And Why You Should Too)

> All customs and rituals can be oppressive, as the social cost of opting out of them is often extremely high.

In India, a few schools that prohibited hijabs in their dress code faced protests from a small group of women. This sparked a discussion about freedom of expression and autonomy over one's body.

I support the right of institutions, both publicly funded and private, to dictate a dress code. However, even if we set aside this argument, there's a more significant reason for my stance:

All customs, rituals, and traditions can be oppressive by nature. The cost of opting out of them is often enormous. This high cost is one of the reasons why religion as a cultural practice survives.

By allowing institutions to ban hijabs, we:

1. Increase the cost of **opting in** to these customs
2. Support affected women and their parents in negotiating with their communities

Conversely, by allowing hijabs, we:

1. Raise the cost of **opting out** of these customs
2. Embolden communities to pressure affected women and their parents to comply

In essence, by permitting hijabs in schools, we have inadvertently failed Muslim women who wish to have a choice in the matter.

It's crucial to recognize that this issue is complex and multifaceted. While respecting religious freedoms is important, we must also consider the potential consequences of our policies on individual autonomy and social dynamics within communities.
