# Why I support schools that ban Hijab and why you should too.


> All customs and rituals are oppressive as social cost of opting out of them is extremely high.


In India few schools that did not allow Hijab in schools faced protests from handful of women and it lead to discussion around freedom of expression, autonomy over one's body.

I do support right of an institutions, publicly funded or privately, to dictate a dress code.

But even if I were to ignore this argument I think there is a larger reason why.

All customs, rituals, traditions are oppressive by nature. The cost of opting out of them is enourmous. This is high cost is one of the reasons why religion as a cultural practice even survives.

By allowing institutions ability to ban hijab, we increase cost of __opting in__ to these customs and support affected women and their parents to negotiate with their communities.

By allowing hijab, we have now instead raised cost of **opting out** of these customs and it emboldens communities to pressurize affected women and their parents to comply.

We essentially failed Muslim women.
