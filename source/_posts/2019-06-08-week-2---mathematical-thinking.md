##### Logical Implication
* Implication involves causality.
* Implication has a truth part and a causality part.
* Mathematics only deals with truth part or conditional.
* &phi; => &psi;
  * &phi; is antecedent.
  * &psi; is consequence.
* &phi; => &psi; means
  * If &phi;, then &psi;
  * &phi; is sufficient for &psi;
  * &phi; only if &psi;
  * &psi; if &phi;
  * &psi; whenever &phi;
  * &psi; is necessary for &phi;

| φ   | ψ   | φ => ψ |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| T   | T   | T      |
| T   | F   | F      |
| F   | T   | T      |
| F   | F   | T      |

##### Logical equivalence.
* Equivalence is similar to equations/equality.
* Biconditional.
* &phi; <=> &psi; if (&phi; => &psi;) ^ (&psi; => &phi;)
* &phi; <=> &psi; means
  * &phi; is necessary and sufficient for &psi;
  * &phi; if and only if &psi;
