Work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky is fascinating and has had lot of influence on the world. The behind the scenes story how their work and how they worked together is equally interesting.

A large part of this book is not just about the invention of behavioral psychology. This book is the story of Israel as well. The wars, the rebuilding, the rise of a brilliant nation, and role of scientists like Kahneman and Tversky in it.
