As per my [about page](/about) I am pursuing few goals from March 2019 to March 2020. Here is update for the second month.

> Ran 5kms without any breaks for the first time. In under 30 minutes!

###### Able speak a new language, Italian.
Continue to make progress on this, streak continues.

###### Travel to Israel, Cambodia, and Vietnam
Israel in August. Have got visa requirements done, will apply in July as it is only valid for 3 months from the day of approval.

###### Acquire a new creative hobby.
Writing. Have started maintaining a private diary and will publish few things from time to time. Still need a hobby which is slightly less abstract.

###### Running my 5km/day.
Really good progress on this. I can run 5km/day. Have been pushing to about 8km/day with 1.5km walking breaks.

###### Travel to 10 states in India that I have not been to before.
Plans are in progress, as soon as monsoon starts. Gujrat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Himachal, Haryana, Uttarakhand.

###### Make friends with people from countries I have never been to before.
Have had minor success over coursera forums, but nothing more beyond that.

###### Acquire new (technical) skills, learn new things.
Continue to make progress in this. I will release couple of side projects later in the year utilising these skills. I completed two courses - [How to negotiate]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-02-successful-negotiation-essential-strategies-and-skills %}) and [How to understand arguments]({ { site.baseurl}} {% post_url 2019-05-03-think-again-how-to-understand-arguments %}). I also did complete a course on [Modern History]({{ site.baseurl}} {% post_url 2019-05-01-modern-world---course-notes %}).

>_Sabbatical from work is not going all that well. Acquired two new clients, one project for an old client, and have three more in the pipeline._
