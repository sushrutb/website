##### Dispute Prevention
* It is more important to predict what people will do, than what courts will do.
* Prevention is about what is driving people to court instead of will we win in court.

##### Alternative Dispute Resolution concepts
* ADR options
  * Mediation
  * Negotiations
  * Arbitration
* Mediation - mini trial
  * A structured negotiation
  * Involves a neutral party, expert in technical/legal field.
  * Litigation is a zero sum, mediation does not have to be.
* Arbitration - Rent a judge
  * Retired judge hired to arbitrate
* Arbitration - advantages
  * Can be faster.
  * Can be cheaper.
  * Private litigation.
  * You get to pick the arbitrator/judge.

##### ADR Tools
* Corporate pledge
  * corporate policy to pursue ADR processes before litigation.
* Screens
  * List of questions for business people.
  * Based on the questionaire it suggests binding or non-binding processes.
* Contract clauses
  * You can include ADR clause in the contract.
* Online dispute Resolution
  * Cheap and convinient, but less effective.

##### Arbitration
* Arbitrator does not have to be a lawyer.
* Arbitration can look a lot like litigation.
  * Opening statements
  * Cross examinations
  * Oauths
  * Closing statements
* Arbitration is binding and cant be reviewed in court.
* Arbitration costs are non trivial, but mostly lower than litigation.

##### Mediation
* Types
  * Facilitative. (traditional)
  * Evaluative. (traditional)
  * Tranformative.
    * Focused more on changing the dynamics of the relationship.
    * Very useful for long term relationships.

##### Contract performance evaluation
* Mindsets of contract makers (deal makers) and contract implementors can be different.
* What did you/we do well?
* How can I/we improve?
