<p>There are lot of people out there who wants to be entrepreneur.</p>

<p>A large percentage of these people only want to be entrepreneur to become rich!</p>

<p>That is not the motivation for entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Most of the times these people will try to piggyback with some one else who is true entrepreneur. Who believes in his ideas, concepts. Who has commitment and passion required to lead those ideas to success.Â </p>

<p>But lot of people just have apetite to take up financial risks. They dont have entrepreneurial drive.</p>

<p>Beware of people who want to piggyback you. And if you have someone like that in your team, get rid off that person.</p>
