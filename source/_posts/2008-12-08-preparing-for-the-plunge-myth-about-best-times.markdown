<p>Did you hear people saying this is the best time to startup? Off course you did, it is all over! Everyone wants you to startup. Every one is saying, &ldquo;Technology has made it the best time to startup&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cost of starting up is so low right now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just assemble your team and starting kicking ass&rdquo;. Fair enough on their part. But I do not agree.

VCs are saying this is best time to start, as off course they are looking for good deals.

Media is saying (bloggers,Â  tech-media) so as they always need &lsquo;something&rsquo; to talk about and drive their own growth.

<em>What you need to understand is -</em>
</p><ol><li>Do you believe in <strong>yourself</strong> and your <strong>vision</strong> for becoming an entrepreneur?</li>
	<li>Do you believe in your <strong>concept</strong>?</li>
</ol>
If you believe in these 2 things, do not wait, just start. No matter where the economy is going. No matter if shadows of war are looming over. No matter if people think you are stupid or brave. You have to, absolutely and 100% , believe in those two things. <strong>Time is right when you set it right</strong>.
