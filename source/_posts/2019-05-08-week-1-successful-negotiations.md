[How to assess your negotiation style] (http://negotiationplanner.com/assessing_negotiation_style.html)

### Plan for negotiation

##### Should I negotiate?
* How do you feel about negotiating in this specific situation?
* What are the risks? (downside)
* Is reward after successful negotiation worth it? (upside)

### Types Of Negotiations

##### Position or interest based?
* Traditional negotiation has been positional.
* Positional - what do you want?
* Interest based - Why do you want something?

| Distributive/Positional | Integrative/Interest Based                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| divide the pie          | integrate interests to find common ground |
| competitive             | cooperative                               |
| win/lose                | win/win                                   |
| zero sum                | non zero sum                              |
| adverserial             | problem solving                           |
| claiming value          | creating value                            |

> Most negotiations start off as positional, but always looks for common interests to build larger pie. And it is an iterative process - positional to interest based to positional.

##### Dispute resolution or deal making?

| Deal Making     | Dispute Resolution |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Forward looking | Backward looking   |
| Interest based  | Positional         |
| Problem solving | Adverserial        |

### How Should I Analyse Negotiation

##### What Questions Should I Ask To Complete Analysis?
* What are your overall goals?
* What issues are most important to you? And Why?
* What is your best altenative to negotiated agreement (BATNA)?
  * What do you do if deal falls apart?
  * This is your leverage, if you have a decent BATNA.
* What is your reservation price? - lowest price.
* What is your most likely price?
* What is your stretch goal?
  * Should not be more than the reservation price of the other party

> Zone Of Potential Aggrement(ZOPA) - The difference between reservation price of the parties.

##### Best Alternative To A Negotiated Aggrement For Dispute Resolution
* Litigation or Arbitration
* Understand the elements of legal process and how it works in countries involved.
* Use decison tree analysis to calculate cost of potential risk and value of the deal/dispute adjusted to reflect those risks.
