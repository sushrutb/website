[How to assess your negotiation style] (http://negotiationplanner.com/assessing_negotiation_style.html)

### Plan for negotiation

##### Should I negotiate?
* How do you feel about negotiating in this specific situation?
* What are the risks? (downside)
* Is reward after successful negotiation worth it? (upside)

##### Position or interest based?
* Traditional negotiation has been positional.
* Positional - what do you want?
* Interest based - Why do you want something?

| Distributive/Positional | Integrative/Interest Based                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| divide the pie          | integrate interests to find common ground |
| competitive             | cooperative                               |
| win/lose                | win/win                                   |
| zero sum                | non zero sum                              |
| adverserial             | problem solving                           |
| claiming value          | creating value                            |

> Most negotiations start off as positional, but always looks for common interests to build larger pie. And it is an iterative process - positional to interest based to positional.
