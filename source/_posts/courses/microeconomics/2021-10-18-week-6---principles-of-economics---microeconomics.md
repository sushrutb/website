### Trade

Benefits
* Trade makes people better off when preferences differ.
* Value to buyer > value to seller for a trade to happen.
* Specialization - boost productivity by creating skilled labour and information networks.
  * It is not possible to know everything about everything. Specialization reduces amount of knowledge required to succeed.
  * Developed countries have more combined knowledge than developing countries.

#### Globalization

Why is it good?

* Increases combined world knowledge.

> Comparative Advantage - The more different we are from each other, the more we benefit from trade.

##### Opportunity cost

* Time and resources are finite.
* You want to maximize your payoff.


##### Summary

* In two country/person examples, trade makes everyone better off, but in larger examples some may be worse off.
* Comparative advantage applies to groups and individuals.
* Diversity is a strength when combined with trade.

### Tariffs and Protectionism

> Protectionism - economic policy of restraining trade through tariffs, quotas, or other regulations that burden foreign producer but not domestic.

Tariff - tax on import.
Quota - Quantity restriction of import.

#### International trade

Effects of tariff that influence welfare
* Domestic consumption reduces.
* Domestic production increases.

Both of these reduce welfare because
* Domestic consumption reduces leading to lost gains from trade.
* Domestic production increases, leading to use of resources in products where they are not as valued under trade, leading to wasted resources.


#### Tariffs

* Increase price, create deadweight losses.
* Direct production from low-cost to high-cost.

Distribution of losses
* Bad for consumers.
* Good for domestic producers.
* Bad overall.

#### Arguments against international trade

##### Reduces domestic jobs

> We pay for imports with exports!

* Trade moves jobs from import industries to exports.
* Wages increase on average due to comparative advantage.
* Problems do arise when low skilled jobs are lost and labour is not up skilled.

##### Child labour

* Child labour is a side effect of poverty.
* Restraining trade due to child labour will further increase poverty and put more children at risk.
* Trade however in the long run will increase wealth and reduce child labour.

##### National security

* Anything can be considered important for national security.
* Key industries at home - Maybe valid for very few industries. But supply chains for those are global and hence still difficult without trade.

#### Cost of protectionism
