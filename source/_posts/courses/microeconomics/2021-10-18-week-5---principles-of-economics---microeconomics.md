### Price Ceiling

> Price ceiling - Maximum price allowed by law.

#### Effects of price ceiling

- Shortages
- Bad quality
- Lines and search costs
- Deadweight loss
- Misallocation of resources

##### Shortages

![Price Ceiling](/images/price-ceiling.png)

##### Bad Quality

Main effect of price ceiling is that Q<sub>Demanded > Q<sub>Supplied. Sellers have more customers so
* They can cut quality, cut costs and still able to sell at the same mandated price.
* They can provide worse service and still be able to sell.

##### Lines and search costs

* Price control does not reduce quantity demanded.
* Consumers outnumber sellers.
* This incentivises consumers who value a good more to pay bribes to buy it.
* More consumers than suppliers leads to lines and increase in time cost.
* Paying in time is wasteful as time is a perishable resource.

##### Deadweight loss

Due to price control, not all profitable trades are made, so  there is a deadweight loss.

##### Misallocation of resources

The key benefit of free market and the pricing system is that
> We want to ensure that consumers who value a good more can secure supply before consumers who value it less.

Example -

* Gold and silver are used in many electrical and electronics manufacturing. It is also used as jewellery.
* If government puts a max price on gold, some of the supply that should have gone to electrical and electronics manufacturing goes to jewellery.
* Manufacturers can not signal to the market that they value gold more by paying a higher price to secure supplies, as there is a price ceiling.
* This leads to shortages in manufacturing and instead allocates resources for jewellery which is not as important area.

> Price system ensures that most important and hence most valued consumers of good are last to be affected by shortages.

#### Rent controls

* It is a type of a price ceiling.
* Makes it difficult to find apartments.
* Often rent controlled apartments are rented by people who do not need them.
* Creates shortages in supply of apartment buildings.
* Over time due to fund shortages rent controlled buildings become decrepit, unmaintained, and dangerous. Many rent controlled buildings fall down in Mumbai, killing people.

### Price floors

> Minimum price allowed by law.

#### Effect of price floors

* They create surpluses.
* Lost gains.
* Wasteful increase in quality.
* Misallocation of resources.

Floors are less common.

#### Minimum wage

Minimum wage is a type of price floor.
Effects of minimum wage on above mentioned dimensions.

##### Surpluses

* Minimum wage creates surplus of labour, leading to unemployment.
* People who may have be willing to work at lesser wage are now unable to find jobs as employers can not pay minimum wage.

Minimum wage affects

* Only small % of workers are paid at minimum wage, less than 5%.
* Large increase in the minimum wage will cause serious increase in unemployment.

Test case
* US government accidentally increased minimum wage in Puerto Rico, by a lot.
* Led to many businesses shutting down and a very high increase in unemployment.


> Communism = universal price controls.
