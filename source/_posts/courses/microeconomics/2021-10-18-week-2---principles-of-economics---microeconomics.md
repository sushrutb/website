### Elasticity

> A demand curve is elastic when an increase in price reduces the quantity demanded by a lot. (and vice versa). Flatter curve.

> A demand curve is inelastic when an increase in price reduced the quantity demanded by very little. Steeper slope.

#### Determinants of elasticity of supply
* Availability of substitutes
  * Goods with many substitutes have more elastic demand curve.
  * Oil - inelastic as not many substitutes
  * Brazilian coffee - elastic as many substitutes
* Time horizon
  * Immediately after price increase consumers may not be able to alter their consumption.
  * Overtime they may.
* Classification of product
  * Broader - more likely to not have substitutes hence inelastic demand curves.
  * Narrow - more likely to have substitutes hence elastic.
* Nature of good
  * Necessities - inelastic
  * Luxuries - elastic
* Size of purchase
  * Relative to consumers budget.
  * Low cost product - inelastic demand curve in short term. Coffee cost increase by 50% may lead to only small drop in demand in short term.
  * High cost product - elastic demand curve.

##### Calculating elasticity of demand

elasticity of demand = the % change in quantity demanded / % change in price.

> E<sup>D = %∆Q<sup>demanded / %∆Price

Example
Oil price increased by 10%, quantity demanded dropped by 5%, so
E<sup>D(Oil) = -5/10 = -0.5

| Absolute value of E<sup>D | Elasticity     |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| E<sup>D < 1               | More inelastic |
| E<sup>D > 1               | More elastic   |
| E<sup>D = 1               | Unit elastic.  |

##### Midpoint formula
To erase base point bias, we use following modified formula.

E<sup>D = %∆Q/%∆P = ((∆Q/Avg. Q) * 100)/((∆P/Avg. P) * 100)
                  = ((Q<sup>after - Q<sup>before)/((Q<sup>after + Q<sup>before)/2))/
                  ((P<sup>after - P<sup>before)/((P<sup>after + P<sup>before)/2))

###### Revenue

Revenue = Price * Quantity

For inelastic demand curve, if price goes up then revenue goes up.
For elastic demand curve, if price goes up then revenue drops.

> Elastic demand is price sensitive. Small changes in price lead to large changes in quantity demanded.

#### Elasticity of supply

Elasticity of supply is a measure about how responsive the quantity supplied is to price.

Elastic supply curve means increase in price increases supply by a lot.
Inelastic supply curve means quantity supplied does not vary much with price.

###### Determinants of elasticity of supply
* Change in per unit costs of production.
  * If high production requires much higher costs, then inelastic supply curve.
  * If supply can be scaled easily, then elastic supply curve.
* Time horizon
  * Easier to expand total production capacity then elastic curve.
  * Expand output only using current production capacity, then inelastic curve.
* Input materials
  * If input materials do not contribute a large percent of toal supply of those materials, then more elastic supply.
  * For example toothpicks require wood. But toothpicks are only a very small consumer of wood supply. So even doubling production of toothpicks will have little impact on price and demand of wood.
* Geographic scope of market
  * Narrow market - elastic. You can easily increase fuel available in one city.
  * Broad market - inelastic. Very difficult to increase total fuel supply in the world.

##### Calculating elasticity of supply

Elasticity of supply == the % change in supply / the % change in price.

E<sup>S is generally positive. Whereas E<sup>D is negative. Otherwise similar math.


#### Slavery

* Case study for elasticity of demand and supply.
* A christian organization tried ending slavery in Sudan by buying slave and freeing them.
* This pushed more people to be slaved.
* Organization buying slaves pushed the price, incentivising slave suppliers to enslave more people.
