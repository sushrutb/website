### Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium


#### Demand curve

>Graphs quantity demanded at various price points. Quantity demanded decreases if price increases, as less consumers are willing to purchase the product.

#### Supply curve
>Graphs quantity supplied at various price points. Quantity supplied increases if price increases, as more suppliers are willing to supply the product.

#### How to interpret supply and demand curve?
* If price of a product decreases, consumers who were buying products which are substitutes, are now buying the product.
* If price of a product increases, suppliers who were making other products, are now supplying the product.

#### Supply and demand equilibrium price point.
* When supply and demand are graphed, equilibrium is where these intersect.
* In a free market, market forces are always trying to push the price towards equilibrium.
* If price is above equilibrium, there is product surplus as demand < supply. This pushes the price down, towards equilibrium.
* If price is below equilibrium, there is product shortage as demand > supply. This pushes the price up, towards the equilibrium.

> At equilibrium, total gains from the trade are maximized.

#### Consumer surplus
* It is _profit_ made by consumer.
* It is the difference between a maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and purchase price.


#### Producer surplus
* It is _profit_ made by supplier.
* It is the difference between minimum price a supplier willing to sell at and sale price.
* Assuming that minimum price set by supplier includes some profit margin, this is the extra profit made by supplier.


#### Demand curve shifts
* demand curve shifts right - greater quantity demanded at _every_ given price point.
* demand curve shifts left - lesser quantity demanded at _every_ given price point.

##### Possible reasons
* Income
* Population
* Price of substitutes
* Price of complements
* Expectations
* Tastes

###### Income
* For normal goods demand increases if income increases. e.g computers, phones, pubs.
* For inferior goods demand decreases if income decreases. e.g fast food.

###### Population
* Demand curve shifts with changes in population.

###### Price of substitutes
* Two goods are substitutes if increase in price for one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good. demand(good1) ∝ price(good2)

###### Price of complements
* Two goods are complements if an increase in the price of one good leads to an decrease in the demand for the other.
* Fuel and cars are complements. If fuel price increases, demand for cars will decrease.

###### Expectations
* Future price of a good will shift demand curve for the good right now.

###### Tastes
* Seasonal goods, fashion, fads.
* Remember pet rock!

##### Supply curve shifts
* Supply curve shifts left - quantity supplied at _every_ given price decreases.
* Supply curve shifts right - quantity supplied at _every_ given price increases.

Possible reasons
* Technological innovations - can drive down prices and/or increase throughput without adding much more cost increase supply.
* Input prices - Cost of raw materials, labour, and other input resources may affect price and supply.
* Tax and subsidies - Additional taxes will drive up prices and shift supply curve up. Subsidies will drive down prices and will shift supply curve down.
* Expectations - Future demand and prices will affect current supply.
* Opportunity costs - If another market has shifted providing better opportunities for supplier, that will increase cost and will shift supply curve.

#### Equilibrium
> Free market maximizes gain from trade at equilibrium quantity and prices.

Does equilibrium work? Absolutely yes!
