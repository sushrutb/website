### <span>Quantifiers</span>

All mathematical quantifiers can be expressed in either _there exists_ or _for all_.

##### There exists
* There exists an object x having property P.
* Denoted by symbol - __∃__
* For example ∃x[x<sup>2</sup>+2x+1=0]
* You can prove it by finding x which satisfies the property.
* ∃! - There exists an unique.

_Continuous function - Graph of the function does not have any breaks or joints_

##### For all
* For all x it is the case that.
* Denoted by symbol - __∀__
* For example - ∀x(x<sup>2</sup> >= 0).


##### How to read mathematical formulas

* (∀x)[P(x) => Q(x)] : For every x, _if_ P(x) _then_ Q(x).
* (∀x)[P(x) ^ Q(x)] : ∀xP(x) ^ ∀xQ(x) : For every x P(x) _and_ Q(x).
* (∃x)[P(x) ^ Q(x)] : There is an x for which P(x) _and_ Q(x).
* (∃x)[P(x) => Q(x)] : There is an for which _if_ P(x) _then_ Q(x). Rarely useful.


##### Negation of quantifiers.

¬(∀x[P(x) => Q(x)]) = ∃x[P(x) !=> Q(x)] = ∃x[P(x) ^ ¬Q(x)]
