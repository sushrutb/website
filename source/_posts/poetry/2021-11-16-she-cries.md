![She cries](/images/she-cries.jpg)

She cries.
Because she likes reading,
when it rains.
Even on a beautiful summer day.

She cries.
Because tears are more familiar.
Even in a warm embrace of her lover.

She cries.
Because happiness feels fleeting.
But sadness will last her a lifetime.

She cries.
