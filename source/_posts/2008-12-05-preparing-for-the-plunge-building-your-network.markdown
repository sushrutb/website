<p>Now this is completely through experience. I did not do any of the following mention things and it hurt us <strong>BIG</strong> time.
</p><ul><li><em>Increase your online presence BIG time.</em>
<ul><li>Start a blog. Even if you are not a great writer. Does not have stories. Just start the blog.</li>
	<li>Put up information from other blogs with links to slideshares/youtubes/celebrity blogs.</li>
	<li>Make sure you start sharing your URL with friends. Use simple SEO techniques to drive traffic.</li>
	<li>Keep updating the blog at least twice a week or so. Make sure you reply to comments.</li>
	<li>Comment on other blogs with link to your blog.</li>
	<li>Make sure you start an independent blog. IE something like sushrutbidwai.com rather than sushrutbidwai.blogspot.com.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul><li><em>Twitter</em>
<ul><li>For now twitter in India is used by people who are very active on entrepreneurship scene.</li>
	<li>Bloggers, entrepreneurs are very active on twitter.</li>
	<li>Use it to connect with the community.</li>
	<li>Have a conversation. Build your network.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li><em>LinkedIn</em>
<ul><li>Update your linked profile.</li>
	<li>Increase your network.</li>
	<li>Be active on groups related to the market your are getting into.</li>
	<li>But don&rsquo;t be open net-worker. Desperation has not given any one results.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li><em>Unconferences</em>
<ul><li>Barcamps and other tech camps like PHPCamp, OpenSocialCamp are great ways to connect with start-up community.</li>
	<li>Make sure you are regular at these events.</li>
	<li>Travel far and wide to reach out to the community across India rather than just your city.</li>
	<li>If possible present something. Conduct few sessions.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li><em>Customer relations</em>
<ul><li>If you know who are going to be your customers, then start talking to them.</li>
	<li>Find out events these people go to and attend those event.</li>
	<li>Subscribe to groups related to your customers on linkedin and be active there.</li>
	<li>Start preparing list of customers you have in second-degree network IE contacts of contacts.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li><em>Competitors relations</em>
<ul><li>Since you are just planning at this stage, competitors will not hesitate in talking with you.</li>
	<li>Conferences and unconferences are great places to talk to competition.</li>
	<li>Connect with talent working with competition.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li><em>Investor relations </em>
<ul><li>This is probably the most important thing to do.</li>
	<li>You will find investors at conferences, events like <a href="http://proto.in">Proto</a>, <a href="http://headstart.in/">HeadStart</a>, <a href="http://watblog.com">WATBlog</a> Mixer and many such events.</li>
	<li>Angel investors are also great help in providing mentoring. They are much more approachable, available and willing to help out young entrepreneurs.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not mention funding requirements ever when you meet investors informally.</strong></li>
	<li>Ask for advice, pointers, guidance. People help you when they like you.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><em>&lt;This is going to be a series of articles. I will also talk about how to prepare for the entrepreneurship itself&gt;</em>
