##### Argument markers
* Conclusion markers - so, thus, therefore, thus, accordingly, consequently etc.
  * sentence after them is the conclusion.
* Reason markers - since, because, for, as, for the reason that etc.
  * sentence after them is a premise/reason.
* If clause does not constitute as an argument marker.

Standard form an argument, helps understand what type of argument one is making.

```
Premise 1
Premise 2
.
.
.
Premise n
 .
. . Conclusion (from 1 to n)
```

##### The problem of skeptical regression -

> Arguments are made of premises. Premises themselves need to be proven using arguments. This leads to regression.

Regress problem can be solved if it is a circular chain of arguments, or infinite regression, or if a premise is unjustified/wrong. Essentially all of these are bad arguments.

Another way to solve the problem is to start with shared assumptions.

##### Ways to solve regression problem.
1. Assuring
  1. Authoritative - i assure you, some trustworthy source tells me
  2. Reflexive - authority is the self.
  3. Abusive - it is only common sense, only a fool will think etc
2. Guarding - Weakening the premise by introducing uncertainty
  1. Extent - reducing applicability of the premise.
  2. Probability
  3. Mental - mental state of the person making the argument.
3. Discounting - citing an objection. Phrases - but, although, whereas, nevertheless, even though, still etc.
  1. The trick of discounting straw people - use easier objections and discount them to keep focus on them rather than possibly more difficult objections.
4. Evaluation - falls with in acceptable standard or widely help standard.
  1. Slanting - negatively evaluating without giving any reason.

##### Close analysis

Analysing an argument, marking various argument markers, language markers such as assuring, guarding, discounting, or evaluating terms.
