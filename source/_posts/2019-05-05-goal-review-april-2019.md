As per my [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% page_url about %}) I am pursuing few goals from March 2019 to March 2020. Here is update for the first month[^1].

> For the first time I completed a coursera course with all assignments with in given time.[^3]

###### Able speak a new language, Italian.
This is progressing well. I am mostly using duolingo right now and have maintained my streak. Now need to find couple of people I can speak it with on a regular basis. Also starting use of Anki app.

###### Travel to Israel, Cambodia, and Vietnam
Plans for these are in progress. Currently thinking is I will go to Cambodia and Vietnam from early November to early December. And go to Israel in Mid march depending on the weather.

###### Acquire a new creative hobby.
I have not made any progress on this yet. As a first step, I did do a course on how to learn new things, which will aide in pursuing a hobby.

###### Running my 5km/day.
Making some progress on this. I have been running and speed walking for 18/30 days. Need to improve on that. Since it is summer not pursuing myself as hard as I should. But need to at least make sure I do this 25-27 days out of 30. Having said so - I did get back to even though I missed it 6 days in a row.

###### Travel to 10 states in India that I have not been to before.
No progress yet.

###### Make friends with people from countries I have never been to before.
No progress yet. Not sure how to do this with out social media. Any ideas are welcome[^2]!

###### Acquire new technical skills - mobile app development, front end development.
Have done some work in kotlin and react native, but not enough. Need to spend more time on this. Did setup travis-ci for this blog and some other projects. Also started doing some serious terraform development work for a side project which is nice.


[^1]: I started these goals around 28 of March so April counts as first month.
[^2]: Except of course going back on social media!
[^3]: In the past I have completed a course, as in watched all the videos. But not with in given time. And have never done all the required assignments.
