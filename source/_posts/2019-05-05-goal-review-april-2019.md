As per my [about page](/about) I am pursuing few goals from March 2019 to March 2020. Here is update for the first month [^1].

> For the first time I completed a coursera course with all assignments with in given time. [^2]

###### Able speak a new language, Italian.
Making good progress on this. Using duolingo is quite effective and I have not broken my streak. I will like to find couple of people who are doing the course and have conversations with them. Hopefully in next month or two.

###### Travel to Israel, Cambodia, and Vietnam
Working out finances and dates for these. Hoping to go to Israel in Sept/Oct. Vietnam and Cambodia in late Feb to early March.

###### Acquire a new creative hobby.
Sadly no progress yet. As a first step, I did a course on how to learn new things, which will aide in pursuing a hobby.

###### Running my 5km/day.
Some progress on this. Have been speed walking and running 18/30 days in April. One week was complete wash out. Good thing is I did not give up but got back to it after that week.

###### Travel to 10 states in India that I have not been to before.
No progress yet. Once summer is over, I will make progress on this.

###### Make friends with people from countries I have never been to before.
No progress yet. Not sure how to do this with out social media. Any ideas are welcome! [^3]

###### Acquire new technical skills - mobile app development, front end development.
Have done some work in kotlin and react native, but not enough. Need to spend more time on this. Did setup travis-ci for this blog and some other projects. Also started doing some serious terraform development work for a side project which is nice.


[^1]: I started these goals around 28 of March so April counts as first month.
[^2]: In the past I have completed a course, as in watched all the videos. But not with in given time. And have never done all the required assignments.
[^3]: Except of course going back on social media!
