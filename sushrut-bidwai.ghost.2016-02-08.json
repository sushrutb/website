While in college I was fascinated with the blogging world, especially blogging about startups and tech. So I applied to be a blogger covering tech at a well known blog and got hired. There during my 3 months I covered startups from bigdata computing, cloud computing, mobile and consumer space. I hosted chat shows and MCed events and so on.</p>\n<p>[SB] So you had good exposure to technology before?</p>\n<p>[BS] None at all. I had no clue about what these technologies meant and what they enabled. But it seems they are really important stuff based on number of pageviews and RTs we were getting. So this shit must be super important you know!</p>\n<p>[SB] Cool. But you left the job when you got hired as a growth hacker right? Tell us more about how that happened.</p>\n<p>[BS] Well, part of my job was to meet lot of budding entrepreneurs and educated them on what gets more PVs and eyeballs and help them in making up stories which achieved our internal goals. On one such meeting I found a startup had a great story. 5 founders, all from great schools with lots of twitter followers and facebook friends. They had a launchrock page for their new startup and yet they were able to get only 13 signups! All the blogs covered their story and it was such a promising startup and it made me wonder why despite all the PR and RTs and Likes, no one is signing up on their launchrock page. What else would a user want? They had a great logo, great about us page with jazzy mouse over events. Product  and problem description were missing. But anyone who has spent 3 months in startup world would tell you that ideas dont matter. People change ideas, they pivot almost every hour if not more. So what was going wrong here?</p>\n<p>[SB] I see.</p>\n<p>[BS] So thought it will be a great challenge to see how I can add more value to this startup and what I can learn myself. So when founder, ceo and managing director, pitched the job of growth hacker, I immediately latched on to it. </p>\n<p>[SB] Awesome! How did that go?</p>\n<p>[BS] Well, first thing we did was compartmentalize users. We talked to all 13 people who signed up. Turned out 5 were founders. (I had not signed up yet, despite writing 3 articles about them!). 3 were launchrock employees. And remaining turned out to be geeks who wanted to make sure they get in on everything that cool before any one. So they can tweet something original and increase there follower count. </p>\n<p>[SB] Well that doesnt sound so promising.</p>\n<p>[BS] Exactly. So we analyzed all the data we had, ran it through hadoop clusters etc. And we realized launchrock just isnt cool any more. That was a big eye-opener. But as they say its never too late. So we decided to pivot. We moved from launchrock to a fully weebly.com hosted website. </p>\n<p>[SB] That is a big move and very risky if I may add.</p>\n<p>[BS] True. Couple of founders were very apprehensive about it. They got too attached to the launchrock page. We had few board meetings and finally they were able to see merits of new strategy. So with everyone onboard, we embarked on creating fully functional weebly site. We A/B tested each and every word. We even A/B tested which A/B testing tool to use! I was determined to not leave any stone turned. Finally after toiling for 30 days we launched new site which had everything. Tweet scroller, PR kit, journey of startup so far. A blog. Everything. Except product of course.</p>\n<p>[SB] Why still no information on product?</p>\n<p>[BS] Well we were not clear what we are going to build. Every who&rsquo;s who in startup community will tell you, it is all about what customer wants. Listen and iterate. So first we needed to get customers. Building product after that is easy. We would just raise Series FU and outsource the whole thing.</p>\n<p>[SB] That sounds good. Go on.</p>\n<p>[BS] So we launched the site. Sent out pressers to every blog and twelebs. They were so impressed with our press kit that they wrote about us immediately. And with in 10 days of launch, 45 days since I joined, we now have 812 sign ups. All organic with out spending any marketing dollars!!</p>\n<p>[SB] *Stands up and applauds*</p>\n<p>[SB] This is brilliant! So what made you start on your own?</p>\n<p>[BS] Now I had two important skills in with me, I could write about stuff I dont understand due to my experience at tech blog. And I also successfully growth hacked a failing startup to enormous success. They are already taking coaching classes to pass interviews at all major accelerators and soon will land with funding and it is a straight drive to Mt Gold from there. So not much challenge left. I thought, I am still young. I am still just 22. I still have 3 good years left in me, so should I take easy route and ride glory with this one startup or should I take risk. Choice was obvious.</p>\n<p>[SB] So tell us about your own venture - youneedabath.com is it?</p>\n<p>[BS] That is right. What I observed in my 45 days at the startup is - I missed shower on 28 days out of 45! That is more than 50%. That isnt good. So I asked around. And all founders, early employees seems to have the same problem. Putting it in to-do list, trello, asana just isnt working for any one. So there is a definite problem which needs a specialize solution. And hence youneedbath.com.</p>\n<p>[SB] What is current state of the startup?</p>\n<p>[BS] Well, we are looking to build initial team. Ninja programmers who are ready to take leap of faith and work for free+equity. Also figuring out launch strategy. See this is going to be mobile-only startup. And there is no launchrock for mobile. There no weebly for mobile. So it is going to be very hard. But we nothing is easy and we will get there.</p>\n<p>[SB] Awesome. I look forward to hearing more about your startup. It is indeed a great journey so far and we are sure youneedbath is going to be the most promising startup there is! Everyone needs bath. So potentially 6B customers! And no one can out-bath you. May the bigdata with you and God&rsquo;s of cloud computing smile upon you always.</p>\n<p>[BS] Thank you.</p>","html":"<p>Interview of Mr BS by yours truly (SB).</p>\n\n<p>[SB] Tell us a little bit about your journey so far.</p>  \n\n<p>[BS] Well I graduated in summer of &lsquo;13 from a second tier ivy league college with highest honours.

They were so impressed with our press kit that they wrote about us immediately. And with in 10 days of launch, 45 days since I joined, we now have 812 sign ups. All organic with out spending any marketing dollars!!</p>  \n\n<p>[SB] *Stands up and applauds*</p>  \n\n<p>[SB] This is brilliant! So what made you start on your own?</p>  \n\n<p>[BS] Now I had two important skills in with me, I could write about stuff I dont understand due to my experience at tech blog. And I also successfully growth hacked a failing startup to enormous success. They are already taking coaching classes to pass interviews at all major accelerators and soon will land with funding and it is a straight drive to Mt Gold from there. So not much challenge left. I thought, I am still young. I am still just 22. I still have 3 good years left in me, so should I take easy route and ride glory with this one startup or should I take risk. Choice was obvious.</p>  \n\n<p>[SB] So tell us about your own venture - youneedabath.com is it?</p>  \n\n<p>[BS] That is right. What I observed in my 45 days at the startup is - I missed shower on 28 days out of 45! That is more than 50%. That isnt good. So I asked around. And all founders, early employees seems to have the same problem. Putting it in to-do list, trello, asana just isnt working for any one. So there is a definite problem which needs a specialize solution. And hence youneedbath.com.</p>  \n\n<p>[SB] What is current state of the startup?</p>  \n\n<p>[BS] Well, we are looking to build initial team. Ninja programmers who are ready to take leap of faith and work for free+equity. Also figuring out launch strategy. See this is going to be mobile-only startup. And there is no launchrock for mobile. There no weebly for mobile. So it is going to be very hard. But we nothing is easy and we will get there.</p>  \n\n<p>[SB] Awesome. I look forward to hearing more about your startup. It is indeed a great journey so far and we are sure youneedbath is going to be the most promising startup there is! Everyone needs bath. So potentially 6B customers! And no one can out-bath you. May the bigdata with you and God&rsquo;s of cloud computing smile upon you always.</p>  \n\n<p>[BS] Thank you.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1388124480000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1388124480000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1388124480000,"published_by":1},{"id":9,"uuid":"5e1dacce-470e-4ee5-a4e3-6b5ee06c243e","title":"Love","slug":"love","markdown":"<p>It was thunderstorm outside as he held her hand.

I can not recollect name of the book as I read it long back when I was in school. But few things from that book.<br/><br/>   Democracy by definition is for the people, by the people, of the people. Now if you look at current implementation of these democracies all across world, what you see is a large nation which has kind of a senate/loksabha where all parts of that nation sends representatives. <br/>  If you look at the Autocracies in history, especially if you dig deep into Shung Dynasty and how they ruled in around 500 years starting from 200 AD to 700 AD in Northern part of India ie above Narmada then it is completely different. What happened was there is one central decision making mechanism which decides bold points. It will be in control of decisions which affects all parts of the nation. For example foreign policy, military. It creates few simple rules which are implemented across all parts of nation.<br/>  Most interesting thing is, there is no fixed definition of the part. A village can be a part, a State or Prant can be a part. So what people get is micro level control in decision making process. <br/>  Courts, Tax structures, Policy making committees were defined at any of such Part level. Group villages can agree to become a single unit to form a larger part. Such groups can come together to form an even larger part and so on so forth.<br/><br/>The advantage is - People are involved in democracy. <br/><br/>Current implementation that we see across the world, be it parliamentary democracy is people involvement is limited to selecting representation. So the basic idea was that people will choose wisely and better people to represent them. But this assumption does not hold true, as people have chosen wrong representatives all the time. Many times due to lack of availability of good people who are interested in representing them.<br/><br/>In part-based democracy, we force people to be involved always, which makes sure that good people, better people who have the requisite qualities necessary to lead are also involved. People are not merely voters but also executers. <br/><br/>Voting is probably the least important responsibility for a person in democracy. Often we do glorify it to be the most important. Reason why I think it is least important is, voting is merely selection. But execution of decision making, development plans are more important than selection. Off course voting is also important but not as much as selection.<br/><br/>Second advantage - Fixed decision makers.<br/><br/>In current form of democracy, especially in India, what we see is some parties come together after election. They break away. People change parties all the time. Around the world also, there is not fixed party which runs the country for longer period.<br/>  Which means that lot of importance in given to administrative staffs, who are not elected members. They do not represent people. But yet they have decision making powers.<br/>  In part based systems, since the decision making is done by the part, which is a physical section of the larger nation, it essentially means that decision makers are going to be same people over a longer period of time. Off course, there will be migrations, immigrations which will affect this. But still I think around 90% of people will be similar. Who understand each other, who understand each others problems better.<br/><br/>One argument you can have is - In India there is already such system in place. From gram-panchayat to Loksabha we have micro to macro level of decision making levels. <br/>  But I doubt it is implemented correctly. In principal, yes it is there and we can be involved in the decision making and execution process. But only upto certain extent. That extent of participation is not at correct level. <br/>  For example, Nasik as a part can not decide its on tax structure. Tax paid by Nasik people, is used only partly in Nasik and there is no transparency to that as well. So money I earned and tax I paid from that is not used by government to provide me with better infrastructure, develop my own city or &lsquo;Part&rsquo;. True, that tax paid by larger parts is used in development of smaller parts, but that should not have been the case. Why should I be responsible for development of other parts of my nation. We are enforcing a rule which is not correct in true sense of democracy. Tax is one such issue, and may be the most controversial one, but if you start thinking about it then, there are many such issues.<br/><br/> For example - Take case of the Tata Nano project in Singure. If we truly had the micro level democracy in place, the issue would not have blown so much out of proportion. All Tata would have to do is take permission from the micro-level decision making framework and execute the project there if they agree. Why the larger part West Bengal needs to be involved. Its their land and they should decide what they want to do about it. They should decide the terms and conditions with Tata directly.<br/><br/> I know that education will be an argument when we think about such framework. People are not educated, people dont understand their own good and hence we need policy makers etc. But we are talking about democracy here. If we dont trust peoples judgment they how can we run a democracy?<br/><br/>More to come in later posts.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-7552260938055258195?l=soranthou.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"/></div>","html":"<p><p>I remember to read a book which discussed true meaning of democracy in depth.

The land of this country was the tiny island itself.

A owned the land. B and C each owned 1 dollar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) B decided to purchase the land from A for 1 dollar. So, now A and C own 1 dollar each while B owned a piece of land that is worth 1 dollar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The net asset of the country now = 3 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Now C thought that since there is only one piece of land in the country, and land is non producible asset, its value must definitely go up. So, he borrowed 1<br/><br/>dollar from A, and together with his own 1 dollar, he bought the land from B for 2 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*A has a loan to C of 1 dollar, so his net asset is 1 dollar.<br/><br/>* B sold his land and got 2 dollars, so his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* C owned the piece of land worth 2 dollars but with his 1 dollar debt to A,  his net residual asset is 1 dollar.<br/><br/>* Thus, the net asset of the country = 4 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) A saw that the land he once owned has risen in value. He regretted having  sold it. Luckily, he has a 1 dollar loan to C. He then borrowed 2 dollars from B<br/><br/>and acquired the land back from C for 3 dollars. The payment is by 2 dollars cash (which he borrowed) and cancellation of the 1 dollar loan to C. As a<br/><br/>result, A now owned a piece of land that is worth 3 dollars.<br/><br/> But since he owed B 2 dollars, his net asset is 1 dollar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* B loaned 2 dollars to A. So his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* C now has the 2 coins. His net asset is also 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* The net asset of the country = 5 dollars. A bubble is building up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(5) B saw that the value of land kept rising. He also wanted to own the land.  So he bought the land from A for 4 dollars. The payment is by borrowing 2<br/><br/>dollars from C, and cancellation of his 2 dollars loan to A.  <br/><br/>* As a result, A has got his debt cleared and he got the 2 coins. His net asset  is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B owned a piece of land that is worth 4 dollars, but since he has a debt of 2 dollars with C, his net Asset is 2 dollars. * C loaned 2 dollars to B, so his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The net asset of the country = 6 dollars; even though, the country has only one piece of land and 2 Dollars in circulation. .<br/><br/><br/><br/>(6) Everybody has made money and everybody felt happy and prosperous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(7) One day an evil wind blew, and an evil thought came to C&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Hey, what if the land price stop going up, how could B repay my loan.<br/><br/>There is only 2 dollars in circulation, and, I think after all the land that B owns is worth at most only 1 dollar, and no more.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/><br/>(8) A also thought the same way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(9) Nobody wanted to buy land anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* So, in the end, A owns the 2 dollar coins, his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B owed C 2 dollars and the land he owned which he thought worth 4 dollars is<br/><br/>now 1 dollar. So his net asset is only 1 dollar.<br/><br/>* C has a loan of 2 dollars to B. But it is a bad debt. Although his net asset is still 2 dollars, his Heart is palpitating.<br/><br/>* The net asset of the country = 3 dollars again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(10) So, who has stolen the 3 dollars from the country? Of course, before the bubble burst B thought his land was worth 4 dollars.<br/><br/>Actually, right before the collapse, the net asset of the country was 6 dollars on paper. B&rsquo;s net asset is still 2 dollars, his heart is palpitating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(11) B had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. C as to relinquish his 2 dollars bad debt to B, but in return he acquired the land which is worth 1<br/><br/>dollar now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* A owns the 2 coins; his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B is bankrupt; his net asset is 0 dollar. (He lost everything)<br/><br/>* C got no choice but end up with a land worth only 1 dollar<br/><br/><br/><br/>* the net asset of the country = 3 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>************ **End of the story; BUT ************ ********* ******<br/><br/><br/><br/>There is however a redistribution of wealth.<br/><br/>A is the winner, B is the loser, C is lucky that he is spared.<br/><br/>A few points worth noting -<br/><br/><br/><br/>(1) when a bubble is building up, the debt of individuals to one another in a country is also building up.<br/><br/>(2) This story of the island is a closed system whereby there is no other country and hence no foreign debt. The worth of the asset can only be calculated<br/><br/>using the island&rsquo;s own currency. Hence, there is no net loss.<br/><br/>(3) An over-damped system is assumed when the bubble burst, meaning the land&rsquo;s value did not go down to below 1 dollar.<br/><br/>(4) When the bubble burst, the fellow with cash is the winner. The fellows having the land or extending loan to others are the losers. The asset could<br/><br/>shrink or in worst case, they go bankrupt.<br/><br/>(5) If there is another citizen D either holding a dollar or another piece of land but refrains from taking part in the game, he will neither win nor lose.<br/><br/>But he will see the value of his money or land goes up and down like a see saw.<br/><br/>(6) When the bubble was in the growing phase, everybody made money.<br/><br/>(7) If you are smart and know that you are living in a growing bubble, it is<br/><br/>worthwhile to borrow money (like A) and take part in the game. But you must know when you should change everything back to cash.<br/><br/>(8) As in the case of land, the above phenomenon applies to stocks as well.<br/><br/>(9) The actual worth of land or stocks depends largely on psychology (or speculation)</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-2630133377069076521?l=soranthou.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"/></div>","html":"<p><p>Once there was a little island country.

His net asset  is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B owned a piece of land that is worth 4 dollars, but since he has a debt of 2 dollars with C, his net Asset is 2 dollars. * C loaned 2 dollars to B, so his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The net asset of the country = 6 dollars; even though, the country has only one piece of land and 2 Dollars in circulation. .<br/><br/><br/><br/>(6) Everybody has made money and everybody felt happy and prosperous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(7) One day an evil wind blew, and an evil thought came to C&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Hey, what if the land price stop going up, how could B repay my loan.<br/><br/>There is only 2 dollars in circulation, and, I think after all the land that B owns is worth at most only 1 dollar, and no more.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/><br/>(8) A also thought the same way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(9) Nobody wanted to buy land anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* So, in the end, A owns the 2 dollar coins, his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B owed C 2 dollars and the land he owned which he thought worth 4 dollars is<br/><br/>now 1 dollar. So his net asset is only 1 dollar.<br/><br/>* C has a loan of 2 dollars to B. But it is a bad debt. Although his net asset is still 2 dollars, his Heart is palpitating.<br/><br/>* The net asset of the country = 3 dollars again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(10) So, who has stolen the 3 dollars from the country? Of course, before the bubble burst B thought his land was worth 4 dollars.<br/><br/>Actually, right before the collapse, the net asset of the country was 6 dollars on paper. B&rsquo;s net asset is still 2 dollars, his heart is palpitating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(11) B had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. C as to relinquish his 2 dollars bad debt to B, but in return he acquired the land which is worth 1<br/><br/>dollar now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* A owns the 2 coins; his net asset is 2 dollars.<br/><br/>* B is bankrupt; his net asset is 0 dollar. (He lost everything)<br/><br/>* C got no choice but end up with a land worth only 1 dollar<br/><br/><br/><br/>* the net asset of the country = 3 dollars.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><em>*</em><em>*</em><em>*</strong> <strong>End of the story; BUT *</em><em>*</em><em>*</em><em>*</strong> <strong></em><em>*</em><em></strong> <strong></em>*</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>There is however a redistribution of wealth.<br/><br/>A is the winner, B is the loser, C is lucky that he is spared.<br/><br/>A few points worth noting -<br/><br/><br/><br/>(1) when a bubble is building up, the debt of individuals to one another in a country is also building up.<br/><br/>(2) This story of the island is a closed system whereby there is no other country and hence no foreign debt. The worth of the asset can only be calculated<br/><br/>using the island&rsquo;s own currency. Hence, there is no net loss.<br/><br/>(3) An over-damped system is assumed when the bubble burst, meaning the land&rsquo;s value did not go down to below 1 dollar.<br/><br/>(4) When the bubble burst, the fellow with cash is the winner. The fellows having the land or extending loan to others are the losers. The asset could<br/><br/>shrink or in worst case, they go bankrupt.<br/><br/>(5) If there is another citizen D either holding a dollar or another piece of land but refrains from taking part in the game, he will neither win nor lose.<br/><br/>But he will see the value of his money or land goes up and down like a see saw.<br/><br/>(6) When the bubble was in the growing phase, everybody made money.<br/><br/>(7) If you are smart and know that you are living in a growing bubble, it is<br/><br/>worthwhile to borrow money (like A) and take part in the game. But you must know when you should change everything back to cash.<br/><br/>(8) As in the case of land, the above phenomenon applies to stocks as well.<br/><br/>(9) The actual worth of land or stocks depends largely on psychology (or speculation)</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-2630133377069076521?l=soranthou.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"/></div></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1228978440000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1228978440000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1228978440000,"published_by":1},{"id":26,"uuid":"bd012232-9e24-470e-bd2d-4e06a189ebe5","title":"Violent India","slug":"violent-india","markdown":"<p>Well thanks to all the violence happening around country, I decided to write something here.

But moral/ethics corruption is far more dangerous. As most often or not, people will fight against each other when things go out of hand. Moral, ethical corruption always lead to bloodshed. This has been proved for years. Mahabharata did not happen because of land. It happened because there was deep moral corruption. It was not about greed of a man or group of men.

We have become such mindless group as a country. We just need one reason to pelt stone at each other. I don&rsquo;t care what Raj T thinks and does. I hardly support in extremists.

No one tried to find out truth behind Raj T and anti Bihari acts of his. No one tried to see whats happening in Gujrath, who killed those Hindus but all were burning down Muslim houses. We are so angry, so worked up. Some people show it through physical violence some show it through online violence. Fuck, asshole have been cult words.

Yes, I have known all this 12 years ago. I knew when you first tried to seek to me.  I knew then only that you are seeking answers to all these questions. You came to me for finding those answers only, haven&rsquo;t you? But yes, you knew you have to wait. And you did, for these 12 long years. You tried to find the answers yourself. And you did find them. Now you are here to just verify the answers, isn&rsquo;t it?<br/> So now you ask me who chooses? Don&rsquo;t you know the answer? By asking this question you in fact have answered this. Yes, you are right. You have to choose yourself. Always. I never had that power. In fact you have to lead me. You are the master and I am just a friend, a guide who can only follow your lead. You have to realize this. Unless you believe you are the chosen one, I am helpless. You have to make the choice. But why do you think its so difficult to acknowledge this? Because its very hard to accept the fact that you are being loved unconditionally. No matter what you do, I will always love you. Its the most scary thing to acknowledge someone is there who loves you, trusts you, believes in you so blindly. I know exactly what you are thinking. I know you have come face to face with this feeling once, and you had run away from it. Wasn&rsquo;t there a friend who said he can trust you blindly. A friend who said he knows you will always be there for him? And what did you do, you run away from him. You chose to cut him out of your life! But I know you are friends again. I know you just needed a little more time to comprehend, to accept that you will try not to ever let that friend down. You tried to see me in such decisions. That was the first time I think you understood what it is to be loved by me. That was the time when you decided to stop seeking me for a year. You decided you want to live without actually looking for me. With out trying to pursue answers to these questions. And you did so for that one year. But we came closer, much closer than ever in that one year. Again it was your choice and your decision. I just followed your lead. We came closer because you stopped trying to bring yourself closer to me. You understood that you have to bring me closer to you. You have keep me close to you all the time and that how all these questions will be answered.<br/> Now you ask me why? Well I really don&rsquo;t think you can find the answer for that. Why somebody should feel, should realize he is meant for bigger, better purpose in life. Why somebody should think he is loved more by me than rest of the mortals? Well there is no answer to this question. But try to ask why not? Why not he should be the special one, he should be given responsibility to shepherd the weaker? Haven&rsquo;t I given each and everyone of you all the powers necessary to lead? The three divine powers of “Prajanan”, “Srujan”, “Nirdalan” . Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh symbolizes these eternal powers only. And each and everyone has them. So why you cant lead? What more do you want to take that responsibility. Why you fear failure. Why you feel are just not good enough, important enough for that. This self realization has to occur. You have to ask yourself why not you?<br/> Why do think Arjun, Radha, Draupadi, Hanuman became so special? Is it because they all loved me with out reasoning? Without ever questioning my powers, my existence. Answer is no! They all achieved greatness, because they all believed that I love them too. That I love them more than anyone else. Just remember, you are only as much part of me, as I am yours. If your heart and soul are mine then my heart and soul are yours too. What did Arjun see when I showed him the “PurnRup”. Did he see me in some gigantic form controlling all the living creatures? No! He saw himself. Because he is the one who realized he is nothing but me and I am nothing but him. He was the only one understood he&rsquo;s been loved truly and completely by me. And thats why he is so special, thats why he was the chosen one.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5416117946427095362-1818380323579430808?l=soranthou.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"/></div>","html":"<p><p><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_cWdd7TsTIWo/SIRIx0EV7EI/AAAAAAAAAIM/3Y95FyJmRvw/s1600-h/gita_updesh_QB90_l.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_cWdd7TsTIWo/SIRIx0EV7EI/AAAAAAAAAIM/3Y95FyJmRvw/s320/gita_updesh_QB90_l.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5225381488284265538\"/></a><br/>[Part One]<br/>I know.

We worked on various kind of projects. Consumer facing e-commerce app, enterprise apps, financial services products, backend infrastructure of of a gene testing labs, mobile apps. So a wide range of projects. Product startup I am doing now is, <a href=\"http://prolinkd.com\">Prolinkd</a>, an Internet app for B2B search and sales.</p>\n\n<p>Following are the differences I observed so far.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lack of business goals understanding - </strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though often I have pushed the companies we worked with to share business goals they are trying to achieve, its not possible to understand everything from where you are. Its mostly refined to a point before being handed down to you to execute. Most of our clients helped in understanding every little thing about business goals, but there is only so much time. Your main objective is reduced to executing technology so that next version can be rolled to market as quickly as possible. So you tend to get into habit, even if unknowingly, to just take up specs and execute on them.</p>\n\n<p>Where as in product startup, every person has to know what business impact will be for things they are working on. At least at very early stage and for very early team members. For example - In services work, when certain decisions were made to change deployment infrastructure, even if I personally understood why the change, I had no further incentive to share this with the team working on it. If they ask you of course share. Now I have to share everything. I was just talking to the guy who is writing up deployment scripts and reiterate multiple times about how critical deployment scripts are. As a product startup we have to iterate quickly. If a customer reports a bug, we will need 10 mins to fix it most times. But if we dont have sound deployment scripts we will have to wait another few hours to apply the patch. And when you can orient some one to think in these hard business terms, they understand things quickly and make sure they take their time but do a great job instead of just good. I sit with our server guy and do the math of calculating cloud costs and better ways to utilize our very little runway.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake, even while running a services company I tried to do all these things. But you as a manager have so little information that it becomes difficult to share that half knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Control</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though for all projects we worked on, we owned the technology side of it. But still we had very little control on choosing. I debated multiple times with a founder on how mongodb is far better suited for his needs than any RDBMS application. I had to end up letting go of the deal. Most services guys would not do that. You are getting a customer, you bring him in and get things done best to your capabilities in given constraints. I learned that hard way.</p>\n\n<p>In product startup, if we are not happy about slightest of things, we wont release it. No matter what internal deadlines are. We were suppose to launch yesterday, but we delayed by another 2 weeks as I am still not happy with 3 major screens and their UI. We have already done entire UI twice. And will do it for as much time as it takes. When you work for some one else, you are not at liberty to take such decisions. You are given a deadline, you ship. Even if code is not well designed, you make peace with yourself that you will come back and re-factor it. Unfortunately pressures of next release will not allow you to do so most of the times. And since client has never seen the code himself, no matter how much you make him aware of that fact, he will still go ahead with next to-do item.</p>\n\n<p>So essentially you dont have control to take decisions which will make what you are doing from good to great. And since decision makers are not aware of the fact that what they have got is just good, they can not take decisions for you as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highs and lows -</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a services shop our highs were defined by new deals and lows by losing out on promising new customers and letting go of existing. As a product company my personal highs are when we nail down UI for a particularly complex feature. Or when we nailed down our middleware/backend architecture. Customers is of course important aspect. But as a services business I required 5 small sized deals to reach a particular revenue target. To achieve same target (with 3 times more profit), I will need at least 800 paying customers. You can not keep obsessing about losing one or two of them or celebrate every time a new customer upgrades to paid version. 800 parties in an year would be overkill.</p>\n\n<p>But most important part of that comes from philosophical change. To win in services business, you need great sales skills. So all your focus in on that part. So your highs and lows are tied with sales performance. Where as in product space, you can win with having a great product and not screwing up sales. So your highs and lows are bound with product performance and not with sales.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attitude</strong></p>\n\n<p>No matter how much you try, your thinking of human resources becomes very different in a product company than in a services company. For example - we right now have 3 interns executing a module which makes it easy for product manager and developers to monitor our product. Almost everything can be re-done through this interface, so that we can analyze everything. Each significant event which can not be tracked through <a href=\"http://mixpanel.com\">mixpanel</a>, is tracked. All back-end actors spit out important logging information and all these are loaded up in the admin module. Anyways enough technical details. Point is - during services work, I generally made interns work on some internal tool or just prototyping some idea. As for me they were non-billable entities. Where as now they are suppose to contribute. If we are investing in their education and training they are suppose to give. And we will be using that admin module everyday. So they got to work on something real which will be used and we got paid back having a working thing we really needed! Now interns, trainees are not just non-billable entities, but contributing members of the team!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Satisfaction</strong></p>\n\n<p>For almost 3 years I lost my sleep obsessing over new deal we are looking to win. Or new people we need to hire to service the demand. Or waiting for confirmation on release status. Those were good reasons to lose sleep over.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am founder and product manager. So I lose sleep when I am just not able to understand and depict how to implement certain features. There is one screen I still have not done any work on and we may just drop it from first set of features, as it anyways does not belong to MVP. I lose sleep when a prospective customers gives me feedback about product, which really makes me think. These are great reasons to lose sleep over.</p>","html":"<p>To provide context - I was running a services company for 30 months. We worked on various kind of projects.

We were suppose to launch yesterday, but we delayed by another 2 weeks as I am still not happy with 3 major screens and their UI. We have already done entire UI twice. And will do it for as much time as it takes. When you work for some one else, you are not at liberty to take such decisions. You are given a deadline, you ship. Even if code is not well designed, you make peace with yourself that you will come back and re-factor it. Unfortunately pressures of next release will not allow you to do so most of the times. And since client has never seen the code himself, no matter how much you make him aware of that fact, he will still go ahead with next to-do item.</p>\n\n<p>So essentially you dont have control to take decisions which will make what you are doing from good to great. And since decision makers are not aware of the fact that what they have got is just good, they can not take decisions for you as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highs and lows -</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a services shop our highs were defined by new deals and lows by losing out on promising new customers and letting go of existing. As a product company my personal highs are when we nail down UI for a particularly complex feature. Or when we nailed down our middleware/backend architecture. Customers is of course important aspect. But as a services business I required 5 small sized deals to reach a particular revenue target. To achieve same target (with 3 times more profit), I will need at least 800 paying customers. You can not keep obsessing about losing one or two of them or celebrate every time a new customer upgrades to paid version. 800 parties in an year would be overkill.</p>\n\n<p>But most important part of that comes from philosophical change. To win in services business, you need great sales skills. So all your focus in on that part. So your highs and lows are tied with sales performance. Where as in product space, you can win with having a great product and not screwing up sales. So your highs and lows are bound with product performance and not with sales.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attitude</strong></p>\n\n<p>No matter how much you try, your thinking of human resources becomes very different in a product company than in a services company. For example - we right now have 3 interns executing a module which makes it easy for product manager and developers to monitor our product. Almost everything can be re-done through this interface, so that we can analyze everything. Each significant event which can not be tracked through <a href=\"http://mixpanel.com\">mixpanel</a>, is tracked. All back-end actors spit out important logging information and all these are loaded up in the admin module. Anyways enough technical details. Point is - during services work, I generally made interns work on some internal tool or just prototyping some idea. As for me they were non-billable entities. Where as now they are suppose to contribute. If we are investing in their education and training they are suppose to give. And we will be using that admin module everyday. So they got to work on something real which will be used and we got paid back having a working thing we really needed! Now interns, trainees are not just non-billable entities, but contributing members of the team!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Satisfaction</strong></p>\n\n<p>For almost 3 years I lost my sleep obsessing over new deal we are looking to win. Or new people we need to hire to service the demand. Or waiting for confirmation on release status. Those were good reasons to lose sleep over.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am founder and product manager. So I lose sleep when I am just not able to understand and depict how to implement certain features. There is one screen I still have not done any work on and we may just drop it from first set of features, as it anyways does not belong to MVP. I lose sleep when a prospective customers gives me feedback about product, which really makes me think. These are great reasons to lose sleep over.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1296117283000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1296117283000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1296117283000,"published_by":1},{"id":55,"uuid":"0cdad4b0-0b30-4c8f-a9bb-0e25452d7d02","title":"Decision making hierarchy","slug":"decision-making-hierarchy","markdown":"<p>Few times I have observed that people tend to barge into decision making process where there are not supposed to.

Off course if we see an opportunity for global product like dimdim, slideshare, zoho we will work on that.

There are few more things I would like to write about, so thought it will be great to make a check list.\n\nFirst of all, whether you <strong>need</strong> a co-founder is itself a big question. This post is not a discussion about that question. I will try to address that question in a separate post.\n\nThis post is about things that you should look for in a person before starting a venture, from a very India perspective.\n\n<strong>Checklist -</strong> \n</p><ol><li><strong>Piggybacker - </strong>Is he trying to piggyback you? If yes, then may be he should not be an entrepreneur, but more of an non-executive member of the team who is just providing some financial support to the team. Call him an angel if you want, but not a co-founder. Details about such piggybackers can be found <a href=\"http://sushrutbidwai.com/2009/02/beware-of-piggybackers/\">here</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Daydreamer - </strong>I have discussed this point thoroughly too, and you can read it <a href=\"http://sushrutbidwai.com/2009/02/daydreaming/\">here</a>. So if s/he is one of those daydreamer, then may be not a good idea to have him/her in the team.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vision - </strong>How far can he see? Can he think ahead of time for the responsibilities he will be shouldering? For example, if he is going to be technology head in the company, can he see where geek community is moving? Can he be one of those person who will lead the community in right direction? </li>\n\t<li><strong>Social - </strong>I strongly believe that you can not <em>create </em>culture in the company. You and your founding teams personality is directly reflected on the team. So if your founding team is not very social, your company will not have lot of social aspects. People will be just coming and working there with out much of interaction. I dont prefer such companies. Hence I would like a co-founder who is social like me.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sacrifice - </strong>Taking financial risks and career risks in one thing. But sacrifice even some part of personal life is a big thing. If your co-founder is going to be attending each and every family event with out even considering current work pressure then he is not a good fit. One of my mentors and a serial entrepreneur told me a very good story about himself. When he started his first company, his wife was pregnant with their first child. Yet he used work from 7am to 2am everyday including weekends! Now he is very successful with millions of dollars. I am not saying everyone should make such sacrifices, but there has to be some. Its a tough thing to be an entrepreneur, no matter how hard you try there are going to be taxes on your personal life. You cant talk to your girlfriend for hours and still be part of next big thing you know.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reason - </strong>Why a person is looking for entrepreneurship? What is a driving force for him? What keeps him awake at night? What will keep him motivated in the journey when your burst you tyre/s ? If money is the only reason, then dont even consider him. Most important reason I would look for is does he drive to be <strong>the </strong>best in what he does.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Comfort zone - </strong>Lot of people have tendency to get into comfort zones. With hints of even a small success such people will start underperforming big time. They will start spending lot of money too. Plus since they cant be fired from the company, that puts them even deeper into their comfort zones. This attitude will soon be reflected on people who work directly with them and so on. Not a good fit. An entrepreneurs needs to be agile in bad times but equally (in fact more) agile in good times. Momentum needs to be carried forward and forward.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Originality - </strong>Some people are original in their thought process initially. But after a while since they are not may be reading things, learning new stuff or not interacting with peers/mentors, they lose their originality. Does your co-founder have a drive to find solutions to problem on their own? Is he original enough and does originality drives him? </li>\n\t<li><strong>Team person - </strong>Its absolute essential for him to be a team person. He should be work for the betterment of the team. Any thing and everything he can contribute to the team, should be contributed. If he is going to keep things to himself, then team as whole is never going to grow. Also fluid discussions in the team are not going to happen if he is not a team person.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Brand - </strong>All co-founders will typically be leading few parts of the company. How big is your own brand in what you do? If you are in technology, are you respected as a programmer/architect? Great people wants to work only with other great people. Does your co-founder have ability to create brand for himself to attract such other great people?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Decision maker - </strong>Last but most important, does he have confidence to take all important decision on his own. Typically an ideal co-founder is some one who can run the company completely on his own without you. </li>\n</ol><div>There are few minor things left unsaid in the post, but above mentioned are the bullet points with which you should evaluate choices you have for co-founder.</div>\n<div><em>Note- I will be using he/him to refer to people and that should not be considered as me being sexiest.</em></div>","html":"<p><p>I have written last two posts on founders/co-founders.

Here it is.\n\n<em>(Before starting flames on this post, do read the last line note.)</em>\n\nWhen I co-founded this company and decided to work with early stage startups, I was faced with technology choices. Ruby was (is) getting mainstream momentum. Many startups were using it. PHP, no matter how much I dislike it, was still used widely. Python with Django was also started getting some ground. .Net and Java being as important as ever. Choices were there, all looking good on surface. Features were all there. We decided to evaluate all these technologies. We both come from deep roots in Java and object oriented technologies and do have some bias towards it. But still we tried to do our best. We listed down all pros and cons for all these technologies. Investigated all of them. Build sample projects/apps in all of them. Talked to experts, technology mentors.\n\nAlso while making the choices we had some limitations on ourselves and this choice should be evaluated against these limitations.\n\n<strong>Limitations - </strong>\n</p><ul><li>We are not building one single product. We will be building many products, for diversified set of applications.

True, for web applications Java is not exactly a suitable choice. So, we started thinking which is the technology that can provide UI features and sit comfortably on a Java backend? You can use any technology for that. But again doing lot of investigation, search (we dont call everything as research) and came to conclusion that <strong>Google Web Toolkit </strong>is the best technology available.</div>\n<div>If you refer to previous post, I have outlined majority of things we consider or should consider while making choices.

If you dont know what GWT is, I will suggest going through some basics before continuing.</div>\n<div><strong>Feature set -</strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>Provides cool Ajax stuff like fading pop-overs, drag and drop and many such things in built.</li>\n\t<li>Though most of the features are available with other technologies too.</li>\n\t<li>Templating is one of the most important feature for UI side technology. Is there any better templating engine than a class? I dont think so.</li>\n\t<li>Why one should learn weird things like % % terminated tags? Weird UI side syntaxs? With GWT all you are doing is writing classes and implementing methods.</li>\n\t<li>Already many UI design tools are available for GWT. Writing your own is not a big problem. All you will be doing is churning out classes from the design tool. Hence performance and usability of such tools is much better for GWT than for other things.</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div><strong>Performance - </strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>On UI side it is just HTML and Javascript code. Java code cross compiled into HTML + Javascript + CSS.</li>\n\t<li>This Javascript code is maintained by Google and open source communities. This gives it chance of getting better and better with every release. Hence more optimized.</li>\n\t<li>GWT is not much of code generation, but more of code replacement, hence limitations that code generation techniques have are not completely applicable to GWT from performance perspective.</li>\n\t<li>Browser specifics etc are handled much better.</li>\n\t<li>No need to write Javascript on your own, unless you want to write your own plugins. Even then, you write the Javascript, write a simple module to cross compile Java code to that Javascript and you never have to use Javascript directly again. Release that plugin into wild ie open source communities and it will keep evolving if its good enough.</li>\n\t<li>So performance not an issue with GWT on UI side.</li>\n\t<li>On backend its Java, so performance can not been an issue there. Java is proven for that.</li>\n\t<li>Also lot of performance improvement tools are available for Java. Caching systems, search engines and many such goodies are there well performing, which can be easily integrated.</li>\n</ul><div><strong>Maintainability - </strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>GWT code is essentially classes. We know that classes are more maintainable than PHP/JSP or other text files.</li>\n\t<li>Since code is just classes, you will be drawing class diagram, sequence diagram instead of screen mocks and screen flow. Now UML digram are backed up with specification and hence more maintainable.</li>\n\t<li>Two programmers can work on same class (but not on same plain text file) without giving too many check in conflicts. Great thing to have when quick fixing is required and you are fire fighting.</li>\n\t<li>Classes are structured, governed by OOD and OOP concepts. Its very easy to understand code written by some one else in the format of class than in a text file, even if we assume zero or 100% documentation.

These parameters are not necessarily for startups, but in general. In the next post, I am going to write about how these parameters gives clear advantage to Java and GWT when it comes to Web applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feature Set - </strong></p>\n\n<p>   Most of the technologies, or the eco system around them, provide enough features to build any application. True, this wont be the case if you are developing an embedded application or application for space craft etc. But most of the enterprise, web application can be built using any of the technologies. Python, Ruby, Perl, Smalltalk, .Net, PHP, Java and Flex provide everything that is required to build an application. From language point of view, these technologies will differ significantly. Features they offer to developers and geeks are not considered. A true geek develops kick ass application, which creates wealth for the stake holders. I never believed that geeks who say &ldquo;I wont work on a Windows machine&rdquo;, are essentially good for the company and its success.  But bottom line is feature set is pretty much common in all the important technologies and no single technology is at advantage here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Performance -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Very selective call. If you are building a next SSN (Stupid Social Network :D ) then you will have to consider serving million users. If you are building a banking system, you will have to consider serving million transactions. If you are an Ajax heavy application, you will have to think of Javascript caching and issues it presents. Performance of the complex business algorithms is essential to the over all performance of the system. Can technology take advantage of multi-core CPUs? Does it support good distributed session management? Does it have strong security features? Can it scale? How big is the footprint of application? CPU Vs Database Vs Memory Vs Bandwidth tradeoffs. One of the most important thing in performance evaluation is, you cant generalize it. In my experience, the only theory which has hold true, is the last statement when it comes to performance evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>   But again, Java obvisouly holds and edge over all other technology. Java deployed on a Linux machine with Sun RISC servers to back up, makes up the highest performance you can get. Although other technologies may not be that far behind. So for a reasonably high throughput requirement system, most of the technologies will provide you support to tune them and make sure you achieve your numbers. If you use Java, then you have to worry a little less about such tweaks that are available. One of the reason is, sheer number of high performing Java apps around and availability of quality Java performance consultation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintainability -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  This is point I consider the most while choosing a technology. All other points does not give clear advantage to any particular technology. But maintainability of any particular technology is so inherent to the technology itself that this becomes a very important criteria for selecting it. A product has to be supported, enhanced, maintained for a long long period of time. Successful products tend to out live the creators. Technologies will change very fast. Product will have to adapt as per changes. Code written by you will need to be maintained by some other, may be less talented person. The code will under go lot of changes as time goes by. Does technologies you are choosing help you in keeping code maintainable? Does it provide clear constructs and architectural/design patterns which are self explanatory? Can you look at your own code written in that technology one year down the line, and explain it to some one else? Is data flow and control flow clearly depicted by the technology? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Talent Acquisition -</strong></p>\n\n<p>   A product typically wont require more than few dozen people to develop. But as the product becomes successful, you are going to need 100s of developers to maintain it, support it, enhance it and keep it improving and delivering value to your customers. Can you acquire such talent which is required to maintain product you have developed using the technology you have chosen? I know a team of 4-5 python programmers who developed a product (not so good product) and when they wanted to expand their team to add few more programmers, it took them 8-9 months to find 2 programmers who fit the bill. If the product was developed using Java/.Net it would have taken less than 1 month, if the product would have been developed using Smalltalk, they never would have found those programmers. </p>\n\n<p>   But that does not mean you cant use other technologies at all. But you will have to know that, you cant rely on the outside to get you talent. In India, no recruiting agency will even understand how to shortlist Python or Smalltalk programmers! So you will have to come up with a contigency plan to cope up with situation. You will have to hire talent which is good in some other similar technology and train them. You will have to hire ahead of the curve and spend money on training. If you can do that, then you can choose such technologies, else not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Distributed team work -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Now lot of experienced folks are going to be pissed off with this, but these are my views from my experience. No matter which product you are building, how big or small it is, at some point in time you will be working in a distributed environment. Some programmers working from home, some from other continent and other timezone. So can technology be so efficient to make sure you can support such distributed team structures. Can multiple programmers work on same module/file without having to spend a lot of time on resolving check-in conflicts? Does technology provide good patterns to support separation of concern, so that you can work in horizontal or vertical team structures with out creating lot of issues? Does the technology at least comes up with a really good Diff tool? :-) .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eco-system -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Your product is going to live long long time if it is successful. True, having a successful product means you can spend money on porting it to whole different technology if required. But such porting rarely happens. We are still bridging with applications which run on mainframes. Businsess will very rarely do such porting. Its risky, expensive. Also are you going to fire all programmers who worked with you in making the product successful? No! So re-training costs. </p>\n\n<p>  So what you need to consider is, how good is the eco-system around my technologies. Will the eco-system evolve as per changes in other tangential technologies? Are the technologies supported by a community which is strong, vibrant and evoling? Is this community lead by a company which makes heaps of money from the technology? Can I find a consultant in particular area, like performance management or memory management,  quickly? Are their enough companies out there who make support product for this technology? Are developer tools and environment available off the shelf? <strong>Are there any outsourcing vendors available who are competent in these technologies?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Time to market - </strong></p>\n\n<p>   People say in todays world time to market is reducing very fast and we need technologies which accelarate the same. I say, time to market was always an essential factor in considering technologies. Today we have large choices of technologies to choose from which provide very different time-to-market and hence the big discussion.</p>\n\n<p>   Again lot of people will say its so easier to build application in a particular technology, that time to market is 50% lesser than other technologies. I say, okay, may be that is possible. But what is time to market? From product concept to first public release of the product is time to market. This includes time for team building too. If it is going to take me 6 months to find good programmers I can work with for a particular technology then how is that going to reduce my time to market? But I will discuss few more things on this issue in the next post, where I talk exclusively about Java+GWT combo and how we are reducing time to market using it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Last but not the least parameter. Why I am choosing this particular technology? Is it a status quo to work in these technologies? Am I a true if only I work on products which are written in this language? Are my customers well versed with this technology? Is the cost of building a product much lesser than other available technologies? There can be numerous such Whys, but you need to be clear about this.</p>","html":"<p>In last few months or so, I have had debates, diplomatic way to say I had fights, with fellow geeks about how to choose technology for a product. These parameters are not necessarily for startups, but in general. In the next post, I am going to write about how these parameters gives clear advantage to Java and GWT when it comes to Web applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feature Set - </strong></p>\n\n<p>   Most of the technologies, or the eco system around them, provide enough features to build any application. True, this wont be the case if you are developing an embedded application or application for space craft etc. But most of the enterprise, web application can be built using any of the technologies. Python, Ruby, Perl, Smalltalk, .Net, PHP, Java and Flex provide everything that is required to build an application. From language point of view, these technologies will differ significantly. Features they offer to developers and geeks are not considered. A true geek develops kick ass application, which creates wealth for the stake holders. I never believed that geeks who say &ldquo;I wont work on a Windows machine&rdquo;, are essentially good for the company and its success.  But bottom line is feature set is pretty much common in all the important technologies and no single technology is at advantage here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Performance -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Very selective call. If you are building a next SSN (Stupid Social Network :D ) then you will have to consider serving million users. If you are building a banking system, you will have to consider serving million transactions. If you are an Ajax heavy application, you will have to think of Javascript caching and issues it presents. Performance of the complex business algorithms is essential to the over all performance of the system. Can technology take advantage of multi-core CPUs? Does it support good distributed session management? Does it have strong security features? Can it scale? How big is the footprint of application? CPU Vs Database Vs Memory Vs Bandwidth tradeoffs. One of the most important thing in performance evaluation is, you cant generalize it. In my experience, the only theory which has hold true, is the last statement when it comes to performance evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>   But again, Java obvisouly holds and edge over all other technology. Java deployed on a Linux machine with Sun RISC servers to back up, makes up the highest performance you can get. Although other technologies may not be that far behind. So for a reasonably high throughput requirement system, most of the technologies will provide you support to tune them and make sure you achieve your numbers. If you use Java, then you have to worry a little less about such tweaks that are available. One of the reason is, sheer number of high performing Java apps around and availability of quality Java performance consultation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintainability -</strong></p>\n\n<p>  This is point I consider the most while choosing a technology.

Great people, good startups and over all a good event. Here is my thought on companies that were short listed for Proto this year.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://indiakhelo.com\">IndiaKhelo</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  A nice concept overall. Not so bad execution either. But problem is they are trying to do too much too soon. That could be a major problem. Also I am not sure how many people will get interested in this. Difficult to create market around such concept. Lets hope they do succeed in creating that. \n\n<strong><a href=\"http://taroby.org/index.html\">Taroby</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  I dont get why I need another email tool. Thunderbird rocks and instead of creating an entire client, why these guys did not create just a plugin on top of thunderbird is beyond me. Not at all impressed by concept or the execution.\n\n<strong>Lords automotive -</strong>\n\n  Good technology and has definite first mover advantage. Trying to move into green solutions space is a good business proposal at this point. Though I am not sure about the segment they are targeting. If they keep focus on scooter segment, they might lose out to electric vehicles sooner or later. But overall a good effort.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://lifemojo.com\">LifeMojo</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  Interesting concept. Good execution and one of the startups that presented it very well. They seem to have figured out game plan and revenue models failr well. There is definite problem they are solving. Though I am not sure about the scale they can reach, but with more internet penetration their graphs should keep going upwards. This is sort of startup which founders will have to work on for years (7-10) to rip the benefits and rewards, which is very challenging. Hopefully they have that kind of perseverance to see through all bad times.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.i-flapp.com/home/index.html\">iFlap</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  No offence to founders or the team behind this startup, but I just dont see value of the technology they have developed. True, they might have developed a great solution, but to a non-existent problem in my humble opinion.\n\n<strong>New Algi -</strong>\n\n  It is good concept and great solution. I have no idea about their business field and hence wont comment much.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://noddler.com/login\">Noddler</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  By the presentation I thought company is using neural networks and speech synthesis/recognition but does not seem so from the demo. All it is doing is some level of customization of the tapes played at IVRs using variable replacements which is not at all impressive. Also from business side, I dont see how they will get people to sign up on their platform unless some incentive is offered. Overall a startup which I wont be watching closely in days to come.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fachak.com\">Fachak</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n   Again similar to iFlap, I just could not see the problem they are trying to solve! This statement is getting truer and truer for most of the &ldquo;dot com&rdquo; startups these days. Mashups is old story boys, bring on something new.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://yoplr.com\">Yoplr</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n   Interesting concept, okayish execution. Problem with such a service, which lets you plan your travel is, unless you attack the market ie travelers in inside out and outside in method, your chances of getting success is limited. Service clearly targets planned vacations like honeymoon, family outings etc. Could be more useful for their business model and revenue generation if they can get in forgein travelers coming to India and Indian travelers going abroad. Indian travelers, travelling with in India, I am not sure about the market size. But has clear exit opportunities with definite strategic partnership with large OTAs in the space. Chances of survival and success seems pretty good, but could be much better.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://remindo.com/\">ReminDo</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  Again I am not at all sure about problem. Execution could have been much much better. As I have already said, Web 2.0 is already old. Pull up your socks and deliver great app in first go. No more chances for early mistakes, business is hard in this space folks. \n\n<strong><a href=\"http://oo-ha.com\">Ooha</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  Nice concept, though a little to forward looking. But its always good to solve a problem before your customers face it. In the long run this one can go big and I mean really big. But again entry barriers are not there and market penetration will take lot of time, so wait and watch it is.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://inkfruit.com/\">Ink Fruit</a></strong><strong> -</strong>\n\n  Awesomeness! Concept is not something we never heard of. There are companies which do similar things in west and even in India. But execution is far far better than any other startups at proto. Definite value, simple and clear revenue model, top notch execution. If they can maintain a great speed to acquire market, they can go big in no time.

If its not then coax GoI to do it.</li> <br />\n    <li>Find out various ways to bring down cost of manufacturing of these bags.</li>\n    <li>Try to project manufacturing jute bags as Kutir Udiyog, for which government already has lot of subsidies defined.</li>\n    <li>Approach giant business houses in consumer goods like Hindustan Lever and have them advertise on these bags.</li>\n    <li>Pitch them this as a mechanism to deliver advertisements as well as brand positioning. Jute bag is something a person will carry while going shopping, so brands will be interested in getting on-board.</li>\n    <li>BSNL, Electricity boards give some concession of around 4-5 Rs if you pay your bills before a certain date. Instead of this try and see if they will be willing to buy these bags for less cost and give them away for free to customers who pay bills on time. By this distribution problem is solved.</li>\n    <li>I am trying to bring Cost of bags delivery + advertisements = Cost of manufacturing.</li>\n    <li>Talk to few political parties and see if they can provide their distribution channels for giving away free bags. Local corporators ie Nagarsevak sends out pamphlet for every other festival instead pitch it to them to give away these bags, which most probably will not see garbage bin straight away.</li>\n    <li>This everything can be done even for profit! Though profits will not be significant but good enough.</li>\n</ul><div>If you are doing something on War on Plastic and needs support then do drop me a line.</div></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1232188702000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1232188702000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1232188702000,"published_by":1},{"id":80,"uuid":"c041824c-f2ba-4b35-b316-7744a08e8f79","title":"Getting more traffic to your blogs","slug":"getting-more-traffic-to-your-blogs","markdown":"<div>\n\nI have not been blogging for a long time, at least not for professional reasons.

This blog, I have been trying to get traffic as this blog is a tool which I use to connect with startup community, bouncing off ideas and getting to know interesting people.

If you need further information contact them.\n\nHere are few things I did for getting more traffic -\n<ul><li>First of all do not count hits through direct addresses. If you really want to understand your traffic hits through direct addresses are not at all helpful. Most of the times these hits will be through your tweets, emails, linked profile. Though they are significant and more the number better it is. But if all your traffic is through these then you are not doing enough to get wider audience.

Though I still do not have good theme and doing away with a okayish one but its much better than what I had previously.</li>\n\t<li>Comment on other blogs and leave your footprint. But don&rsquo;t just comment on big blogs like Techcrunch, Pluggdin and others. Comment also on people who share similar ideas like you. Who are talking about similar things like you. Comment in depth and relevant to topic.</li>\n\t<li>Talk about exactly one thing in one post. Do not clutter your posts through many different things. Make sure your title is clear about what post is about. Title means page title and not necessarily post title. If you can keep post title also close enough, well done.</li>\n\t<li>You tag cloud extensively. Search engines do pick up side bar and having good number of tags helps. Your readers will not object I think even if your tag cloud is cluttered and has just too many things.</li>\n\t<li>Host your blog. Your blog should be <a href=\"http://www.blogname.com\">www.blogname.com</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.blogname.wordpress.com\">www.blogname.wordpress.com</a>. Total cost of hosting this blog is around 1500 Rs per year, which is like a movie + pop corn + couple of beers for you and one significant other these days.</li>\n\t<li>There are few plugins which help in getting more traffic. All in One SEO pack is one such good plugin. Use it and fill in the required fields in it for every post. Also fill in fields for homepage.</li>\n\t<li>Another good plugin is Sitemap generator. It generated sitemap automatically so search engine bots can pick up site easily.</li>\n\t<li>Guest posting. This is the most important thing you need to do. Contact authority blogs related to your subject, as well as peer blogs related to your subject and guest post on them. Since the time a major Indian blog related to startups published my post with linkback my google hits are tripled! But don&rsquo;t stop after publishing a guest post at such blogs once. Keep on publishing a guest post every other month of similar higher ranked blogs. Remember live and more recent links are much more important than stale or dead links.</li>\n\t<li>Get an editor. Having an editor to represent your thoughts is good. Now this blog does not have an editor due to money issues and feel free to donate. But if you can get a freelance editor, typical charges 5$ per post to 10$ per post, then get one. It will greatly improve your content and hence engagement with readership. It will also eliminate embarrassing spelling mistakes, grammar problems</li>\n\t<li>Most important thing is publish a post regularly. Create a schedule and stick to it. Be it as less as 1 post per week to 1 post everyday, what ever you are comfortable with. But stick to your blogging schedule.

Vision:</strong></p>\n\n<p>  Vision has to be presentable in one or maximum two lines. If it takes more than that to tell your vision, you are not very clear about it. Do your homework find out what is <em>the</em> most important thing you want to convey and generally that is your vision. Now once you have that one line, print it out on a paper and stick on top of your monitor. If after reading for a week continuously you feel its still worth a goal to take all the required risk, then you are on right track.

Kidding.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Executive Summary:</strong></p>\n\n<p>  One pager giving away information which gets readers like partner, customer, new hire, investor (in order of importance again!) interested in reading further. This one page document essentially, when you read it after a gap of several weeks, will give you everything you wanted to know about your own venture. Problem you are solving, solution overview, competition, market and structure of your team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Team:</strong></p>\n\n<p>   This is the most important part. And the part where most of the entrepreneurs make mistake. All focus on plus point, which is good to sell the team to VCs. But to really understand yourself put down all plus and minus points about every one involved. Right from socially awkward to technology genius are all important attributes. What you need to find out is who is best in doing what. There are several responsibilities a team has to take care of in a venture. All things are not as big as designing state of the art banking system or pitching to Fortune 500 client. There are lot of small things like who is better person to talk to a local electricity related person in case of any problem, who can handle low level operational things like writing invoices and cash-memos. Found out these thing about your team and put them together. Sure, while presenting this to VCs you may want to remove some things from the list, but internally maintain entire list. And make sure everyone involved is working on improving on some basic set of skills, if they are lacking in any.</p>\n\n<p>   Also note down skills missing from the group and how you are going to acquire them. If you are going to recruit a marketing head, what you have so that best marketing person available will be ready to work with you? How are you going to find these missing people. Your team structure and roles various people involved are going to play.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Competition Analysis:</strong></p>\n\n<p>  This again is really important piece of information for any stake holder. Keep this part updated regularly. You have to <em>know </em>your competition. Right from how much money they have raised, from whom, for how much valuation to who are the core non-founding team members. You have to know everything about your competition. Their marketing strategies, strategic partnerships, investors, customers, outsourcing partners and every other person who has a tangent with them. Find out about what your competition is strong in and what are its weak points. What differentiation your are offering. Overlap of features. Your unique selling point/s. All this is very important when you start marketing your product/service. <em>Never look at competition negatively. </em>Competition always helps you, at least most of the times. Frankly if you could not find single competitor to your offering, I think you are understanding the term competition in itself.  Also one quote I always remember is &ldquo;There is <strong>always </strong>enough room at the top&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Market opportunity:</strong></p>\n\n<p>   Never lie about market opportunity. At least not to yourself. Yes, VCs will look for billion or at least few hundred million dollar market size. But if you do not have that kind of market, does not mean you can put up your fantasies here. Specially for dot com startups I have found people really struggling with how to evaluate market opportunity. If you have done competition analysis thoroughly then that will help to some extent. Important thing is how much money your customer is going to make or save using your product. Typically some ratio (1/10th I think) is the price customer willing to pay for your product. This can be a good way of finding true valuation. Though I am not very good at this myself :-) .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exit options:</strong></p>\n\n<p>   There are good times exit options and bad times too. Good time options include merger and acquisitions, going public. who will be your potential buyers. Which companies will be looking to merge with you to gain strategic advantage. Is your market size big enough for you to go public at some point? Can you keep running the company with good return on investment for lifetime with out reaching any of the exit milestones. </p>\n\n<p>   Bad time options include selling off your technology, user base, marketing channels. Are you creating any patents or technology that you can sell off? If yes then to which companies? Why would they buy? Are your creating marketing channels which a particular company will be interesting in acquiring? If you are a dot com startup, then what user base you minimum need to reach to at least cash-in some part of investment if things dont work out?

They have to pay dividends, provide market guidance, provide information about capital expenditure. If a startup is well funded i.e. backed by VC, it typically has amount of cash necessary to compete with biggies.

And Google decides to copy your idea and build a me-too product. Good, in fact great for you.

You have only one thing to focus on. They have 100s or 1000s of things asking for attention. You are competing with, say, only them. They are competing with lot of such entrepreneurs in varied markets. So you can move much faster. Adapt to market requirements quickly. Your spiral of innovation is much more faster than theirs.  One example - It took months for Google to actually integrate Orkut and Blogger or Orkut and Picasa.

If you want, check the amount of job postings for Android on freelancing websites. It has rose by at a very high rate and in 6-12 months time it will take over iPhone.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mash-up</strong> - With Mozilla ubiquity now available for beta testing, I see mash-ups hitting a whole new level in next year.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Enterprise 2.0 </strong>- Its not more of technology, but still there is significant technology part involved in it so. Enterprise 2.0 is not just about having collaborative environment for enterprises, but its about collaboration between tools, frameworks from different vendors to talk/communicate collaborate with each other. Open ended architectures with web service interfaces are already being implemented. But with rise of SaaS I see this taking a big leap.

They are number 1 (for some time now) and will be number 1 (for some time more at least).</p>\n\n<p>2. Hotmail - Fast communication is much more important than search of information IMHO.

Have a real time messaging with people staying apart. Now world with out IM is boring.</p>\n\n<p>4. Skype - Whoa 3 out of top 4 are related to communication. Thats how much I care about communication and any innovation which helps us in communicating with people we care about. I remember I used to be in a Skype conference call for 8 hours per day when I was working in Yagna! And these were free calls.  Amazingly useful service.</p>\n\n<p>5. AOL - Again people at right time did the right thing in the very right way. Never used it much but stills deserves a place in top 5 for sure.</p>\n\n<p>6. Amazon - From selling books online to cloud computing, who would have thought!</p>\n\n<p>7. Wikipedia - I have not cleared dust of the encyclopedia my father bought for me when I was 12 in last 5 years. Power of Wikipedia + Google.</p>\n\n<p>8. Yahoo! - Email, chat, search a portal with fun and color. I wish they dont die, but survive to be there in Web3.0/4.0/5.0 waves. Only if they stop creating new social networking application every couple of months I would put them in top 5.</p>\n\n<p>9. Paypal - Yep, I thought long and hard for number 9 and 10. First 8 were natural and instantly identifiable. Paypal gave customers security to spend online. May not be rated as highly as services like Flickr, Youtube and other similar media content sharing apps but again IMHO one of the top 10 reasons.</p>\n\n<p>10. Youtube/Flickr/Digg Combined.

First 8 were natural and instantly identifiable. Paypal gave customers security to spend online. May not be rated as highly as services like Flickr, Youtube and other similar media content sharing apps but again IMHO one of the top 10 reasons.</p>\n\n<p>10. Youtube/Flickr/Digg Combined. I really dont want this list to be more than 10, so awarding joint 10th position to these 3 sites. Note I am not much of a user of any of these and would love to include blogger instead of these sites. But popular opinion is youtube+flickr+digg better than blogger alone.</p>\n\n<p>You have other list?

So we are listened to in making decisions, changing few things around to make it better event. People who participate, attend such events are also very passionate, full of energy and life.

Most of these events are having high entry barrier. Unconferences are typically free. But most importantly people attending these are full of energy, helping and understanding.

I often see people who are looking to build enterprises are stuck with mindset of businessmen. Below are in my opinion differences between businessmen and entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power of equity:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need to understand that you have an idea around which a success story can be built. The only power you have apart from your own skills is equity. If equity is put to good use i.e. in hiring great people, you are creating more  chances of success. Lot of entrepreneurs think that diluting your equity to mentors, advisers, great engineers, sales people is waste of equity. This cant be more wrong. When you hire people who are best in what they do, you give your company more chances of success. Hence effective value of your equity is increased, so essentially you are not diluting at all! I will even say if your customer is interested, sell him some part of your equity. More people involved in realizing one dream, more chances of it becoming a reality. Don&rsquo;t be greedy about your equity spending. Its worth something only when you succeed. Take top companies and find out how much equity holding founders had when companies reached a exit point and you will know what I am talking about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strict control:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can&rsquo;t build a great company if you are not ready to give freedom to your team members. You are not a baniya (a shopkeeper) who will shout at his employees (? or servant?) for every little mistake. True he needs to do that, you don&rsquo;t. Your job is to find good people and build a relationship with them. Sell them your dream.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Delegation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are lot of things that need to be done to build an enterprise. You can not do that all. Make sure you have your own path in the company. At first you will have to do lot of things right from HR to marketing to coding! Decide when you want to delegate some of those tasks. Find and groom people to take over your responsibilities. Don&rsquo;t try to become hero and work 24 hours a day doing everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brand building:</strong></p>\n\n<p>How people see you and your company is VERY important. There are lot of small bakery product chains in India. In north Maharashtra we have this chain of bakery products called Modak&rsquo;s. They have close to 50+ shops now. But they can never become McDonald&rsquo;s. There are numerous such examples in India. When you don&rsquo;t spend on building your brand, well you will create a great business but you cant create a great enterprise, Period. Spend on branding, not just your companies, but your own too. Customers don&rsquo;t differentiate from you and your company be it a consumer product or enterprise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Openness and transparent operations:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you can not trust some one, you can not include him in executing your dreams. You can not go and ask his opinion, neither involve him in any which way in your dream building. But once you trust, (after lot of background search etc etc) trust people. Be open about your professional relationship with them.  This is true for customer relationships as well. IF you tell your customers you were sick and hence did not answer email about something important, well you can do that once not always. Also demand money every time you help out some one. If you always try to make 10% on a 10K deal you wont ever get involved in 10M deals. Some things, some favors should be given just for building relationships. Don&rsquo;t ask for extra money for home delivery packages, that&rsquo;s not what enterprises do!</p>","html":"<p><em>Please note this is just my take on whole concept of entrepreneurship.</em></p>\n\n<p>Many entrepreneurs think and act like businessmen.

How to do it? Well that&rsquo;s a million dollar question isn&rsquo;t it? Here is some free advice to mobile SMS platforms. If you are looking solutions for your own platform send me a gift that I would REALLY like and will post about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Government and organized institutions like Nationalize banks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My father worked in Maharashtra irrigation department for 35 years. From 2006 he told me that District Collector communicates using SMSes! Reach to them. Go and talk to these people and make them see how they can use SMSGupshup like platform (SMSGupshup sucks, as its branded wrongly, so first build me too product with much better branding).</p>\n\n<p>These large monolithic organizations require sending of memos (often one-liners) and receipt of memos. See if you can make them use it for the communication.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>First time in 20 years 5000+ Nasik people were left homeless due to floods.  Fire-fighters often need to  communicate with large audience. Emergency services, police, blood banks all need mechanism to communicate with community to get there support. Evangelize your platform for them, customize it and they will buy it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latency of content </strong></p>\n\n<p>Internet is slow content delivery mechanism. When I say that, I mean a person has to be logged into Internet and be looking for stuff. Whats latency of your delivery platform? If its SMS, user is always online, content delivered in say 2-5 mins depending on bandwidth etc etc. So if you are using SMS for content delivery, think about who need fast information irrespective of where they are, traveling or in toilet! Few examples of such target audience for something like SMS content channel is Brokerage firms and there custoemrs, helath-care corporates and its staff, event managers. One quick example of all places you can use it is think out of the box. I attended Barcamp Mumbai 4 recently. It was a good experience. Problem was unconference nature of the event means sessions are rescheduled, venue for a session changed many times. I missed 3-4 sessions which I was really looking forward to. SMS to the rescue! Thats the power of thinking out of the box. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Trade fairs and organized events</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the previous blog post about how you can create user base from farmers, traders easiest way is to use trade fairs for educating people. Don&rsquo;t send your sales team to these events though, they are generally afraid of that. Send your product evangelizing team. What you don&rsquo;t have product evangelizing team??? &lt;very dirty look and thinking if you are from B-school&gt; .</p>\n\n<p>There are many more ways to do it, for the list of the rest develop good wordpress theme for this blog and help me maintain it :-) .</p>","html":"<p>Now after reading my last post, you know you need to evangelize your platform. How to do it? Well that&rsquo;s a million dollar question isn&rsquo;t it? Here is some free advice to mobile SMS platforms. If you are looking solutions for your own platform send me a gift that I would REALLY like and will post about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Government and organized institutions like Nationalize banks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My father worked in Maharashtra irrigation department for 35 years. From 2006 he told me that District Collector communicates using SMSes! Reach to them. Go and talk to these people and make them see how they can use SMSGupshup like platform (SMSGupshup sucks, as its branded wrongly, so first build me too product with much better branding).</p>\n\n<p>These large monolithic organizations require sending of memos (often one-liners) and receipt of memos. See if you can make them use it for the communication.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>First time in 20 years 5000+ Nasik people were left homeless due to floods.  Fire-fighters often need to  communicate with large audience. Emergency services, police, blood banks all need mechanism to communicate with community to get there support. Evangelize your platform for them, customize it and they will buy it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latency of content </strong></p>\n\n<p>Internet is slow content delivery mechanism. When I say that, I mean a person has to be logged into Internet and be looking for stuff. Whats latency of your delivery platform? If its SMS, user is always online, content delivered in say 2-5 mins depending on bandwidth etc etc. So if you are using SMS for content delivery, think about who need fast information irrespective of where they are, traveling or in toilet! Few examples of such target audience for something like SMS content channel is Brokerage firms and there custoemrs, helath-care corporates and its staff, event managers. One quick example of all places you can use it is think out of the box. I attended Barcamp Mumbai 4 recently. It was a good experience. Problem was unconference nature of the event means sessions are rescheduled, venue for a session changed many times. I missed 3-4 sessions which I was really looking forward to. SMS to the rescue! Thats the power of thinking out of the box. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Trade fairs and organized events</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the previous blog post about how you can create user base from farmers, traders easiest way is to use trade fairs for educating people.

If you are a budding entrepreneur then before creating your killer app consider these points that come up in this post. Its good to target a large existing user base and hey you got idea to get rich. But it will be better if you keep that scalability to your platform to reach non-existent user base and make sure your delivery channels reach them in short term OR long term future.</p>\n\n<p>For example, SMSGupShup has lot of user base, market momentum and everything is good and they will make tons of money, or at least I hope they do as an entrepreneur myself. But problem is they are focusing too much on the Gupshup part of it. I recently developed similar app for a brokerage firm that wanted to use SMS as THE media of communication with its client base of 5000+ customers. Now I told them about SMSGupshup and they said they cant use something names so funny for professional purposes. Now I was trying to make them use it as I was not going to get paid for developing it as its my friends firm. Though he did send me Johny Walker Black Label 24 for my birthday! Why they did not want to use SMSGupShup, because its named Gupshup and gives impression that its for fun and ONLY for fun. So I think the brand does not have scalability, but that another post in draft about brand scalability.</p>\n\n<p>Point I am trying to make is, think about existing user base of a media and think harder about non-existent user base and whoa you got yourself much better business model and hence more chance of making it big. Taking case of SMS channels for instance, can&rsquo;t you reach to customers in villages/taluka places who have mobiles but don&rsquo;t use SMSes? You can. I know you will say in comments section that these people can&rsquo;t type SMS and literacy rates are low and every other problem. Instead think about can they read the SMSes? Yes they can, believe me I do lot of field work and I know lot of them (30% approx)  can. So who can send them useful SMS which these people, like farmers, can use for there advantage? Traders. For example, Nasik exports grape to global market. Lot of farmers who export them are not literate but are rich and have mobiles. Now you can bridge these farmers in Nasik to exporters in Mumbai using SMS channel. How? Let me explain. Go to traders in Mumbai and see how they work. For every day they will call n differnt farmers telling them todays market price and if they want to sell for that market value. Otherwise farmers go directly to markets and sell it for available market price with out holding for better valuation for tomorrow (or is it always yesterday?). So you can help farmers get good pricing for there goods and you can help traders in managing there supply chain using SMS channels. Makes sense? I thinkso. </p>\n\n<p>Though this audience is little harder to reach, but I think user base is so huge that once you penetrate in that market segment you are going to be rewarded n times for your hard work and evangelism.  Educate people and wider audience about your platform while you are doing good job at reaching to existing customer base.</p>","html":"<p>There are numerous applications which are developed to take advantage of mobile and SMS penetration in India.

Get over your techie instincts if you want to be successful. I know its not possible to have entire dev team working for you from day one, but get over it as soon as possible.  If you keep wasting your time and energy on smaller tasks then you are going to lose.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1222753618000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1222753618000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1222753618000,"published_by":1},{"id":106,"uuid":"d2a146ec-8485-42b7-92ba-08f6f396e09c","title":"Recruitment Design","slug":"recruitment-design","markdown":"<p>Probably the most important responsibility of any entrepreneur is to hire good people.

Finding houses that we both like is tedious. Initially we were sending each other links and then discussing if we both liked it or not. Once we liked a house we wanted to keep track of open inspection time. Or schedule a inspection with agent. \n\nInstead of doing all this, I decided to code a simple solution with out having to deploy an app or maintain a server and so on.\n\n> Basic requirement for the app is to be extremely easy to use and automate as much as possible.\n\nSo keeping above in mind, this is what I ended doing.\n\n######Step 0 - Create requirements\n\n* Make a list of suburbs which worked for both of us.\n* Make a list of requirements - Number of parking spots, bedrooms and so on.\n\n######Step 1 - Code a simple scrapper\n\nI have used [jsoup](http://jsoup.org) a lot in the past. My previous shopping search engine app used it extensively. So I used that again to code a simple scrapper and attribute extractor. Scrapper runs everyday and fetches data from [realestate.com.au](http://realestate.com.au). \n\n######Step 2 - Database\nI had no intention of hosting all this data myself or maintain a schema. I anyways wanted to try out [firebase](http://firebase.io) and hence decided to just use that.\nScrapper created in Step 1, validates the data, adds hygiene to it and then pushes it to a firebase collection.\n\n######Step 3 - Build a UI\n\nInstead of maintaining a database or something which is cumbersome to maintain, I decided to just create two separate pages with same content but injected with hardcoded userids. I use one link and she uses another link. Pages themselves are built using [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com) and work flawlessly on mobile.\n![](/content/images/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-12-18-23-36.png)\n\nWe both give thumbs-up or down to the houses we like. \n>Creating a tinder like experience has been the key idea behind this exercise.\n\nThese pages, along little bit of Javascript and UI artefacts are all hosted on [dropbox](https://db.tt/NeUOFrM)! \n\n> By outsourcing content hosting to Dropbox, I did not have to be worried about up time. Even if it is just supporting my partner as a user, it is still lot of work and creates a dependency. Ultimately the app had to be useful and uptime is the most important part of that.\n######Step 4\nWe both look at the houses in our spare time and like/unlike them. Every time we like/unlike a house, that information is pushed to firebase. A script runs everyday which just does a set intersection to find the houses we have both liked. \n######Step 5 - Create calendar event\nI have created a shared google calendar \"Inspection times\" which will have all the \"events\" related to house search. The script in Step 4 also pushes events to this calendar. Scrapper extracts open inspection times from the house listing and then create events with time, location, agent information and adds that to the shared calendar.\n\nIt has been an interesting problem to solve technically, even though most of the tech part was just wiring up off-the-shelf components. \n\nThank you [@thinrhino](https://twitter.com/thinrhino) for proof reading.","html":"<h4 id=\"orhowiusedtechnologytosimplifyhousesearch\">Or How I used technology to simplify house search</h4>\n\n<p>My fiancée and I are moving out of our current rental and looking for a new one in Melbourne.

Pages themselves are built using <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com\">Foundation 5</a> and work flawlessly on mobile. <br />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-12-18-23-36.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>We both give thumbs-up or down to the houses we like.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Creating a tinder like experience has been the key idea behind this exercise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These pages, along little bit of Javascript and UI artefacts are all hosted on <a href=\"https://db.tt/NeUOFrM\">dropbox</a>! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By outsourcing content hosting to Dropbox, I did not have to be worried about up time. Even if it is just supporting my partner as a user, it is still lot of work and creates a dependency. Ultimately the app had to be useful and uptime is the most important part of that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h6 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h6>\n\n<p>We both look at the houses in our spare time and like/unlike them. Every time we like/unlike a house, that information is pushed to firebase. A script runs everyday which just does a set intersection to find the houses we have both liked.  </p>\n\n<h6 id=\"step5createcalendarevent\">Step 5 - Create calendar event</h6>\n\n<p>I have created a shared google calendar \"Inspection times\" which will have all the \"events\" related to house search. The script in Step 4 also pushes events to this calendar. Scrapper extracts open inspection times from the house listing and then create events with time, location, agent information and adds that to the shared calendar.</p>\n\n<p>It has been an interesting problem to solve technically, even though most of the tech part was just wiring up off-the-shelf components. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thinrhino\">@thinrhino</a> for proof reading.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1444629946878,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1444710657344,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1444632614222,"published_by":1},{"id":113,"uuid":"c5dc8c34-42e7-4aa1-a7ae-43e67e729b47","title":"How LinkedIn will fall?","slug":"how-linkedin-will-fall-2","markdown":"*I have followed LinkedIn for few years now and built a product on top of it.
